Damouron. 1⁷

100qu any one believe that England would produce an assassin
more savage than even the common executione-¹²², who could not bring
himself to pollute the sword of public justice with the blood of his
king 3—more savage than even that Cimbrian slave, wh0, when ordered
to, assassinate Caius ,Mai-ius, was struck with· such awe at the majesty
pf theman, that he could not be prevailed on to execute his sanguinary
errand? But the great men of that Parliarnent, who beheld without a
tear, and even with delight, that most shocking murder of the King,
bear away the palm ‘of cruelty even from Nero himself, who ordered,
but did not assistat executione. The precedent which they established
for posterity, without any warrant from their ancestors, was more ter-
rible than the deed itself 3 and if the authors of valuable discoveries
deser-ve immortal gratitude, shall not these reap everlasting infamy, not
so much for the perpetration, as for the original conception of this exe·-
crable crime? The proverb says, “ precedent is law;’' how then can
we designate the injustice (to use the mildest phrase) of a crime which
is without precedent in all antiquity: and which has bequeathed to
posterity a most accursed model for imitation. Nothing in the annals

of crime equals' their guilt, unless we compare tliem to Pausanias and -

Hermocrates. “ How,” asked Pausanias, “ can 1 best secure an immor-tal
name with posterity ?’' “ Your wish is granted,'’ answered Hermocrates,
“ if you murder some illustrious man ;” a suggestion which was instan tly
carried into effect by Pausanias, in the „assassinatio'n os Philip of Mace·
don. The members of the House of Commoris acted the part of Her--
mocratesg the king's executioner was another Pausanias. The former by
counsel, and the latter by deed‚ preferred the everlasting stigma of
most savage cruelty to the silence of oblivion. Perhap3, as they were
senators, they had before their eyes the example of the Roman Senate, .
which approved the parricidal act by which Nero doomed his mother
Agrippina to death.

All the mur-ders committed in Ireland, by all the' seditious hands,
do not approximate even remotely in guilt to the murder of the King,
not taking into account even the provocation the Irish received⁰‚ and·

- that their own defeats were more numerous and more fatal than what

they inflicted on the enemy 3 sor ‘⁶ the King alone, as they say, is all.'’
