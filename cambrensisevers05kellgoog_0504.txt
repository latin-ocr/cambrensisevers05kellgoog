⁸ To those who are not acquainted with the
- Essey, so often citedin those peges, namely‚
Dr. Petrie's Antiquities os Tura ΗιἹΖ, it
may be usesul to know the plan of that
work, and its results, especially as many of
the monuments of that once royal palaee
are connected with Cormae. Tara ceased
to be a royal residence in the year 565.
Its royal monument-s must, therefore, have
been erected before that date, yet nearly all
of them can be identified at the present
day, from the manuscripts published by Dr.
Petris, which describe them such as they
were previous to the twelsth century et
least. Two maps of the hill are given
(pp. 105, 128) 3 the former compiled from
the manuscripts, the latter giving *the pre-
sent appearance of the hill. The conformity
between the two is so striking, that the
tourist, with both maps in his hand,·has
little difficulty in recognising all the prin-
cipal remeius, though, to the esreless ob-

servet, they appear to beonly broken ditches,
or natural inequalities of surfaee, or ordi-
nary raths, like those so common through-
out Ireland. The'l'eaeh Miodchmirta cannot

be mistsken. The fidelity of Irish tredi-
tion, its aeeordsnce with actual remeius in
the case of Tura Hm, is one of the argu-
ments on which we ean rely for the truth of
the few meagre reeords of Irish Psgan events

“ given by T‘ighemach, the only historin or

Pagan events, who, in the Editor's opinion,
is likely to command belief ς though the
publication of the other copious poems on
the same period will assuredly‚ at no dis·
tant day, solve fully the long vexed ques-
tion on the primitive population of Ireland.

⁸ For the state of the aris among theb-ish,
from the earliest ages down to the English
invasion, the reader is referred to chep. xii.
p. [112], infr-ci, in which Dr. Lynch has
collected many passages from ancient na· ·
tivc writers on the subject.
