Giraldus asserta ‘⁴ that St· Beanus protecte not only birds, hut their
eggs 0100, 111 a wonderful and most singular way. For if you stretch
0111 your hand 'to seiae the eggs, yon will immediately see ‘chick'ens
bare and red, as if just issuing from the shell; if you withdraw your
hand, you see again the chickens, either by a mix-acle or mag-ic, contrary
to the course of nature, returning to or changed into eggs 3 ,but lettwo
approach together, one to look on, suppose, and another to seiae them,
the former will see egge, the latter chickens². ” Stanihurst censures
this story, and observes that the change must have been effected by
bewitching the eyes. ·

“In the western part of Connaught,” says Giraldns,‘ ‘there 10 an
Island called Aran, which they say was blessed by St. Brendan. There
human bodies are never buried and never rot, but lie exposed under ·
the air, proof against corruption. There the wondering morta] can see
and recognise his grandfather, and great-grandfather, and his grand-
father's grandfather, and the long line of 1110 progenitore. ,Another
very remarkable thing' is, that no rat is found 111 that island, though
Ireland is very much infested with rats· But a rat neither breeds
1101· lives in Aran, and should one by any chance be imported there, it
gauops away instantly to the nearest shore, and casts 110011ἱ headlong
into the sea, or dies 011 1110 spot if it happen to be stopped.” Now this

but he gimo no pmof os his asem-tion. Ac-
oording‘ to Oolgan (Aeta Sanctorum, p. -

dm, another by Baithen, 0011 of Cuanach.
The 11011100 of these saints would spund to
the ear of Giraldus like Bean3 but there
010 no means of identifying the church to
which 110 refers, nor of discovering the fact

' that may be enveloped in his legend. There

was a 101110 falcon 01 Kildare, tame birds
in other ehurches of the saixats, and in 1110
lonely 1110011101ῃο of 1110 north, hallowed by
the ehurch of a patron saint, the wild birds
could enjoy 0 reposo which fame might

magnify into the extraordinary appear·
011000 recorded by Giraldus.
