of 1300 years, the spuriousness of those old documenta which stated
that Pope Marcellinus had sacrificed to ido‘ls ?-a story which rested on
the authority of ancient writers, was inserted in the ecclesiastica] regis-
ters, and had other collateral evidences, but which was at last unmasked
and exposed„ Let it not, therefore, be matter of surprise, if Ι undertake
to refute statements made by cambrensis 400 years ago, which are un-
supported by our records, or the testimony of authors, or any other
solid ground os truth, and have no other source than his own fancy or
the rumors of the vulgar.

“ We know that of old the funeral notes of the dying swan were
proverbial for sweetness. The opinion was sanctioned not only by
all the poets and painters from AEschylus downwards, but also by
the most eminent philosophers,--Plat0‚ Aristode, ChrysippuS‚ Philo·
stratus, “ cicere, and Seneca. But Pliny, and aster him Athaeneus‚
ascemined, by ‚repeated experimentS, that such was not the fact, and
at the present day there is no doubt on the matter. It was asserted,
not by one or tw0, but by thirty historiam, that Charles, Duke of

and prepossessions of the vulgar, are extinguished.” Gellius very justly
approves the sentiment os an ancient poet, who called truth the daughter
of time, because, though she may lie hidden sor'a period, time will at
last reveal her. Eor the truth of facts does not present of itselfa suffi-
ciently obvious and developed tissue, but is rather wrapped in an in·-
tricate and impenetrable sold, and, as some of the great philosophers
remarked‚ is so deeply buried, that not the life‘of one man, scarcely
even the labor of successive centuries‚ can extricate it⁸. “ There is no
prescription against truth,” says Tertullian‚ ‘⁶ neither lapse os time, nor
favor of man, nor privilege of country.’' Who has ever found fault
with the ancients sor undertaking to 'refute the errors of preceding
writers? One hundred years after the death of Celsus, Origen refutes κ
his writingS, and‘no man censures him for doing so· Sixty years after
the death of Porphyrius, his works were refuted by ApollinariS, Bishop
of Laodicea. St. Augustine, who fiourished 120 years after Manes, has
