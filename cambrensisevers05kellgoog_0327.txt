law on all who should retain any arms¹².” Here is a zealous exhortation
to the English to remove every obstacle to the gratification of their
revenge and cruelty on the unarmed and helpless Irish. Can there be
any doubt that, of all rnen living, Giraldus was the most atrocious enemy
of Ireland? Or is it with suspicion merely, and not rather with con-
tempt, we are to receive the tales which such a man gives us of the
history os Ireland?

His total disregard for 'truth can be proved by another fact, the
very caustic censures with which some writers have branded him·
Thus, according to the unanimous consent of historiens, Harold‚ King
of England‚ was slain in the commencement of the battle of Hastings,
fought against William the conqueror. But Giraldus‚ with more inso-
lenee thantruth on his side, opposes himself to the torrent of histo—
riam, end maintains “that Harold was not slain in thet battle, butonly
wounded3 that he lost an eye, and, having fied to Chester3 lived there
the‘ life of a holy anchorita„ But it is not to other writers only he is
opposed3 he often contradicts himself. “ The land of Demetia is well
supplied,’' he says, “ vvith corn, wine, and fish; and, what is still more
desirable, from its contiguity to Ireland‚ it enjoys a salubrious tempe-
,tature of climate. These advantages make it one of the most beautiful
and powerful regions of cambria. In all Cambria there is not, assu-
redly‚ a more charming spot. Let no person, then, be surprised3 let
none censure the writer, who pours forth the choicest panegyrics on
his native soil, the land of his fathersl‘.” But let us hear how he de-
scribes this native land in another place: “ This corner,” says he,
“ stretches the farthest out into the Irish sea; a roeky, barren, and
ungrateful soi13 neither clothed with wood nor intersected with rivere,
nor adorned with pasturage, but exposed defenceless to storms and
tempests.” Ι subjoin the opinion of David Powel on those two pas-
sages. In the first, he says, ‘⁶ Giraldus acts in the spirit of the poet:
