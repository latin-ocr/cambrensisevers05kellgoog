Ν either is Aran more free from rats? than any other part of Ireland.
Camden thus demoliahes, with a single stroke, this fabrio of fiction
regerding Aran and the Isle of the Living: “ The Ialed of Amn, fabu-
loualy styled the lales of the Liv‘ingff’ My o‘wn opinion is, that Giraldus
bungled his narrative by applying to Aran what is told of Inisgluair,
an island off the eoaat of Erris, in the county' of Mayo. For the bodies
buried m that island do not deeay; but even the hair and naila grow‚

so that one could recognise his grandfather&

He gives a long list of welle, to which nature had imparted, he says,
very wonderful propertiea·‘ ‘There ιε a well ln Munster‚ and whoever
is washed with it· water becomes instantly grey. There ia another well
, in Hister, and whoever bathea in it never becomes grey. In Connaught
there is a well, whose watera are salubrioua for human uses, but whose
very taste poisons floeks and herde, and beasts of burden, and all sorta
of animala. The pebbly aand of this well, if only applied to the mouth,
at onee assuagea the eravings of thirst. There is awell in Munster, and
if any man touch or even* look at it, ‚the whole province is instantly
deluged with rain, which never eeases, until a priest, appointed for the
purpose, and who hes been a virgin in aoul as in body fromhis infancy,
celebrates mass inea little ehapel (founded near the well for the purpose),
and appeases the well by an aspersion of holy water, and the barbarous
and unmeaning rite of sprinkling the milk of a heifer of one eolor.”

(uss, 'renity Collega, ouban, 1. 4. 15), omn, about a mne west of the village of
etates it was then believed that no rat or Omns, pariah of Kilmore, Eri-ia. For several

meuse could live in Iniagluair.— ΨΜ Con-
nanyM, p. 82. It vas aleo believ³ed that

no bodies rotted there, and ‘⁴ the tradition

is still vividly remembered by the inhabi- -

tanta of Erris and Inia Seidhe.” ...J‚ O’D.
In O’thmy’s tima, ,the tradition was
proved by expet-ieme to be salzb—We&
Connauqht, p. 82. The island was καθά
to st. Brendan. It ia now uninhabited,
but contains flie- ruina of a ehumh and
other buildings, which, together with the
leeks and other gurden herbe stin growing
wild, are the sole monuments of audent
monastic civilization. Inisgluair lieo in the

particulare of its history, aee West Gon-

liahed. The rat ia elaaaed among the veno·
mona animala from which Ireland was free.
