eiscus.Patricius‚ ‘⁴ can be supposed to master so familiar an acquain-
tance with foreign affairs as would enable him to write a perfect his-
tory.'’ This was, in 'my opinion, what induced Ferdinand, one of the
wisest princes of his time, to intrust his own history, and -that of his
Queen Isabella, to a Spanish grammarianb, rather than to the ItalianS,
Angelo Pontiano, or Hermolao Barbare, or Pica Mirandula, the most
learned and eloquent men of their age. Lebrixa himself, the author of
that history, whose correctness and honesty are universally admitted,
openly declares in his dedication to Ferdinand, that a writer could never
throw his soul into the history of a foreign nation3 that the affairs of
Spain were as little known to the Italians as those of Italy to the
Spaniards; for, according to the adage, a fool at home knows more
than a wise man abroad. It was, therefore, more imprudent for Gir-aldus
to venture to write on the affairs of Ireland, because, being a foreigner,
he could not explore the secret sources of Irish history.

It may be said that Dionysius of Hallicarnassus‚ though a Greek, 1s
a better authority on the history of Rome than Livy, Tranquillus,
Tacitae, or Arriam but this asser-tion does not affect my position, be-
cause, though Rome was a foreign state to him, he compiled his his·
tory from authentic sources, the archives of the state, andall preceding
writers, He was on tel-ms of intimate familiarity with Varro, Tubero,
and Pompey the Great3 and thus was able to write with more truth and
judgment on Roman affairs than those wealthy and distinguished citi-
zens of Rome, Fabius, Sallust, or Cato. N either isit a solid objection
to my opinion, to urge the ready credit given to Caesar on the (hals,
or Tacitus on the Germane, or Polybius on the Romana, or Ammianus on
the Franlm, because, though foreigners, they were perfectly acquainted
w-ith the antiquities of the nations on which they wrote. If Giraldus had
been well versed 1n Irish antiquities, and had drawn his history from
Irish monuments solely‚ his country should not disentitle him to our
willing confidence. But as he never took the slightest trouble‘ in in-

“ specting or publishing our authentic documenta or antiquities, and as·

he was totally ignorant of the Irish language, no person should be
surprised ‘if we suspect his authority. ·
