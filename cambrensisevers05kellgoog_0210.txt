¹¹ If English was spoken commonly in
all the towns, it must have been a strange
jargon, when an address from Limerick to
the Earl of Essex was such as Harrington
describesz 44 1 know not which was most to
be discommended3 words, composition, and
oratory, all of those having their particular
excellencies in barbarism, hai-shness, and
rustical both pronouncing and action.”—

¹¹ According to O’Sullivan (Hier. cath„
p. 35), the Fingallian was a compound of
English and Irish. Sir william Petty states
that, in his day, 1672, it was neither Eng-
lish, In‘sh, Welsh, nor Wexfordian.-Pol.
Anat„ p. 371, Dublin, 1769. But, accord-
ing to Stanihurst, who was a better judge,
both in Wexford and Fingall “ the dregs of
the old ancient Chaucer English were kept3
thus, they called ‘ a spider ’ ἀπ atter-cop,
4 a wisp ⁹ a wad, ‘ a lump of bread ’ a pocket
or a pucket, ‘a sillibucke ³ a coprem, ‘ a
fagot ’ a blaze, 4 a physician ’ a leeoh, 4 a
gap ’ a elcard, ‘ a household ' α meanis», 4 a
dunghill’ a mizen, ae„ The wbmen have,
in their English tongue‚ a harsh and broad
kind of pronunciation, and utter their words
so peevishly and faintly, as though they were
halfsick and ready tocall for a posset.” They
also placed the accent on the last syllable in
dissyllablea as “maritet” ‘⁸ markeat.” ‘² If
those faults w‘ere corrected, no man,” he says,
“ could complain of their English.'’ But it is

clear that the Fingallians were ridiculed
abroad for not knowing Irish, and at home
for not knowing English. Against the
former charge, Stanihurst, then a Catholic
priest, defends himself by saying that ‘⁸ he
could find in the Pale many 4 toothless old
men,' who could not understand, much
less speak Irish :” to the second, he replica,
44 that men now-a-days, in England, thought
they were speaking the best English when
they were not speaking English at all.”-·-

truth is, whatever English remained in Ire-
land felt but slightly the influence of the
revolution which formed the English lan-
gusge in the reign of Elizabeth. Many of the
great literary men of the day, most of whom
had studied with Stanihurst in Kilkenny,
were afterwards eminent Catholie priests,
and of course paid more attention to the
Latin and Irish, which were the only means
of influencing the mass of their countrymen.

⁰ This must be understood of 'the small
part of Meath which was governed by Eng-
lish law. So late as 1576, out of 102 vicars
in the diocese of Meath, eighteen only could
speak English. Sydney, who made that
repon, mentions fifty other churches‚ which
were‘ better served, but yet “badly‚‘’though
it was enacted so early as 1537, that no
benefice should be given to a person who
spoke Irish only, until proclamation had
been made four days in the nearest market-
town, sor an English- speaking candidate..-
