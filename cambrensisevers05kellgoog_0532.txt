(p. 455, n. θ, supr-d), the Deagaidh tace presente all the appearance of a people ‘siuking
under a more powerful rece. They rallied occasionally, for instance, under Conary Π.
and Lugaidh Mac Gon, but, with the exception os the Dalflatach branch, which was eon-
founded with the Irian in Ulidia (Recede Ecclesiastical Antiquam, p. 852) and the
Ithians of Corcoleidhe (diocese of Ross), they soon ceased, as O'Flnherty (p. 322) and
Dr. O'Brien (Book ⁰f Riqlas, p. 42) observa, to figure among the leading familias in the
island. The fate of their tace is represented not inaptly by that of oue of their chief prin-
cipalities. Muskerry, so called from the Deagaidh‚ Oerbry Musc, once included the richest
part os 'lippa-ary, Limerick, and Cork, but is now confined to the most barren district in
the latter county. It would be too tedicus to propose other arguments. For the present,
it is enough to say thet, by a line of reasoning nearly the same as that employed (p. 461,
n. Ρ), it may be insen-red thet the lthian race, taking it to include Deagaidh, Dalfiatach,
netga, Ernei, hc. be, must at one period have occupied nearly the whole south of Ireland,
the plain of Leinster and Meath3 and that the invasion of Munster and meter, by the
so-called Eiremonian Deagaidh, was nothing more than the retreat of the Ithians of een-
trel Ireland before the invading Belga. ‚

Charles,O’Conor places on his map two tribes of Iberiens. If there were any such in
hela-nd, they were certainly Ithian. To test the truth of his conjecture, 1 submitted to
Mr. O’Donovan a selection of [ber-ian named especially topographical prefixes and suffixae,
taken from Humboldt's “ Inquiry into the Primitive Population of Spain=.” The result
is, that the difference between Iber-ian and Irish topographical nomenclature is in general
eo great that, even where they agree, it is more natural to infer that Humboldt was mis-
taken, than that we had an Iberian colony. For instance, he states that the word “ bearna”
is Basque or Iberlan, and that it means a hollow between mountains (p. 41), the sense in
which the word is commonly used in Irish. There are other coincidence„ but the went
of a good Irish dictionary, which would give correctly the ancient end modern topogra-
phical forms, rendere it impossible to prononnce a safe judgment ς especially as lberinn and
Celtic forms are sometimes eo confounded in Sphin, thet neither Astarlao nor Humboldt
can dist‘mguish them. It would therefore be prematur-e to infer, from mere topographical
names, that we ever had a purely Iberian colony in Ireland3 but there are several rea-
sons, none conclusive of themselves, yet all tending ιο prove the truth of the constant and
universal tradition, that we had et least a Celtiberico colony, and that the Ithians were
that colony. Thus, there was a place named “ Manain-iv in Spain—Humboldt, p. 25.
Baschaoin, the name of a Deagaidh tribe in the county of clare, sounds very like Basque,
Vasque, the various aspirated forms of Ense, Ausc, the national name of the ancient Ibe-
riane-—Ibid- p. 55. There was alno a Rauda in Spain-p. 20„ Now, the three most
distinguished branchos of the Deagaidh are derived by tradition fmm three biothers,
Casberry Musc, Carberry Baskin, and Car-berry Reudm— oquia, p. 322. There is also
in general a greater resemblance between the Spanish end Ithian names (ibid. p. 3293
1νίεή Νεηκίω, p. 263) than between the Spanish and any other clau of Irish narnea It
