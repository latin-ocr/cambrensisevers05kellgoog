snoring comfortably on sost bede of down ἰ’ If the dreamy spirits of the

Elysian plains do not come to the rescue, Ῑ fear Giraldus’s laureis aro
blasted:

“ Two gates the silent house of slcep adeun
of polished ivory thia—that of transparent horn!
True visione through transparent horn arise3
Through polished ivofy pass deluding lies.'‘

This ivory gate of Elysium, Ι am sure, saw many a dream flitting
up to Giraldus. His opinions on this matter were extremely rash and
extremely obstinate, opposed alike to Scripture, to the Fathers, and to
the dictates of natural reason.

But such censui-es on rashness and pertinacity could not deter Gi-
raldus from patronizing other branches of superstition. As wave presses
wave‚ rolling successively over each other, sc, when he had once tasted
the illicit sweets of superstition, heis urged by an insatiable passion to
plunge deeper in the black art, and complete his knowledge of dreams
by the kindred science of augury. But the result of his project was as
unsatisfactory as its conception had been temerariouS. ‘⁴ Not long‚” he
writeS, “or about two years before the descent of the English, a fish
was found near carlingford, in Ulster‚ which had three golden teeth, of
about fifty ounces weight; an omen, perhaps, of the golden days of the
impending and approaching conquest.” Such an interpretation of the
prodigy is setting a saddle on a bull in the best style. Had it portended
anything to the inhabitants of Ireland, or the Church of God‚ it must

have portented evil, if the character of this omen is to be tested by ·

the voice of history, for the Church was shockingly deformed, and the
Irish were robbed of a large portion of their country. These facts
Giraldus himself admits,--the former frequently, -the latter' 111 all· its
vivid details3 so that, out of his own mouth, those first days of the
English robbers· m Ireland were an age, not of gold but of' rron, when
the sword hewed down everything- m its path. Listen to his own pathe·
tic plaint on the sorrows of the Church: “ The clergy of this island
are beggared3 the cathedral churches mourn, despoiled of their ample
lands and domains‚ the gift of the confiding and tendet piety of former
days. Thus has the exaltation of the Church ended 1n the spoliation of
the Churchrz’
