rians surrendered without conditione to M. Popilius, Consul, but with
the hope that the Consul would not be more rigorous in his punish-
ments than former generals. But he deprived them all of their arms,
and sold themselves and their property. The Senate judged the pro-
cedure too atrocious, and accordingly decreed that the Consul, M. Po-
pilius, should return the price to the purchasers, restore the prisonem
to liberty, see them re-established in their proper-ties, and allow the
manufactum of arms at all times among that people ς finally, that the
Consul should retire from his province when he had restored the sur-

not kindle all his wrath.” When the hand of Grod strikes in this life,
it is like the mother and the physician. “ For we suffer thus for our
sine, and though the Lord our God is angry with us a little while for
our chastisement and correction, yet he wiu be reconciled again to his
servants? Most certainly, in his own good time, God will come to our
assistance, for he is faithful, and will not suffer you to be tempted
above that which you are able. “ He seems to have taken pity for the
greatness of the evil, and said to the angel who destroyed: Itis enough,
