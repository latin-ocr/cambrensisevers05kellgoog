adj icit: “ Vivit hac nostrii aetate Orusius ad lyram post hominum memo-

¹ From these words, and a subsequent
passage, in which Giraldus describes “ the
tinklings of the s'mau stringe (of the Irish
har-p) under the deep notes of the bass,” it
is inserted, by Bunting and othere, that the

Irish were acquainted with ‚counterpoint and .

harmony in the twelflzh century. For the
proofs of this position the render is referred
to the works of Mr. Bunting, to whom we
owe our most valuable information on the
music of ·Ireland. cambrensis, with his
usual capi-iciousness, has omitted to supply
that amount of information which his re-
marks on the music of Wales and Nor-
thumbria would entitle ns to expect. The
Welsh, he says, “did not sing in unison like
the inhabitants of other countries, bnt in
different parts, it being customary in Wales
to hear as many different parts as there

were performers, who at length united with
organic sweetness. This species of vocal
melody was not adopted generally in Eng-
land, but only in the parts bordeting on
Yorkshire; with this difference, however,
that the N orthem English sung in two
parts only-the one murmuring in the bass,
the other warbling in the trebie-”-De-
scriptio Cambrt‘oe, c. 18. This passage,
taken literally, would appear to prove that
the Irish did not sing in two, or many
parts, like the Welsh or Nori-hem English3
but asGiraldus frequently indulges in vagno
lang-uage and general assertione, it would
be raah to infer that he excludes the Irisli,
especially as his description of the instru-
mental music of the Irish and Welsh is the
same. The northern English, he supposes,
borrowed their hamon)- from the Danas οι·
