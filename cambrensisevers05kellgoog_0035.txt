most owing, most intolersble grievmoe, is, thet we are brought before
‚ the Μ of the English Perlisment for condemnation or soquittsl83 it·
senators cannot sit in judgment on us,' ss we ere both subjecte os the
same supreme authority. It is sn sxiom ,of law ‘⁵ that peer has no
jurisdiction'over peer.” The lsws enscted by the Perlisment of Eng-
land were never binding in Irelsnd before they were rstified by the
Parliement of Irelsnd. Strangers end foreigners were never, within

“ No eollesgue sor a KIng.”

The members of the English House of Commons, representing the
feelings of their constituente, after having obtained pardon from you
for their most heinous crimes, most strenuously insist that the same
pardon shall not be extended to us, sor what they call our similar
offences3 like the servant in the Gospel, who obtained the forgiveness
