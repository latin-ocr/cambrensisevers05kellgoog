authority os John Clynn‚ “that Camus O’Caruill was a famous per-
former on the tabor⁸, and a Phoenix in execution on the harp, and so
pre-eminently distinguished with his school of about twenty musicians,
that though he could not be called the inventor of stringed musical
instruments, he was the master and director of all his own contempo-
rariae, and superior to all his predecessors.” ·1 may add likewise the
authority of Polydore virgil, who sayS, ‘⁴ that the Irish practice music,
and are eminently skilled in it. Their performance‚-both vocal and
instrumental, is exquisite3 but so bold and impassioned‚ that it is
amazing how they can observe the measured rules of their art amidst
such rapid evolutions of the fingers and vibratione of the voice: and
yet they do observe them to perfectioan’

It is by no means surprising that the same music should be relished
by some and disagreeable to others, according to their different skill or
taste in musical science‚ as some food is relished by some and disliked
by others. But honey and sugar are not sour because they taste so to
the sick, nor is wine insipid because it is disrelished by the abstemious.
Neither should Irish music be condemned because it is not agreeable to
some tasteS. But perhaps the conflicting opinions of Giraldus and

⁴ Stanihurst can be reconciled if we take into account the different times

in which they lived, “ for,’' according to the proverb, ‘⁶ distinguish the
dates, and you will-reconcile conflicting rights.’' In the days of Giral-
duS, Ireland was not subdued3 her Irish kings were in full possession of
their power, and the tones of joy and mirth predominated in her music;
but a sad change for the worse had come over her before the time of
Stanihurst, and the airs which her musicians then attuned to the
harp invariably breathe a certain tone of sadness⁰; for which reason a
