stroyed.” How, then, could he describe accurately, or give his reader
a defined picture of those regions on which he never set his eyes? In
another place I shall have a better opportunity for examining his other
qualifications for history. For the present, suffice it to say, that his
great and sole object was to heap together popular storiesz and, there-
fore, his history ought to be exploded. “ There can be no dependence,’²
says Bodinus, “ on those who have nothing to write but what they
heard from others.” And Melchior Canus: ‘⁶ Grave and prudent men
do not adopt the silly stories of the vulgarss’

But though the fact of his being a sti-anger, or his ignorance of the
Irish language, should not impeach Giraldus’s title to the fameof a good
hist-oriam at least his' inveterate hostility to the Ir'ish nation must un-
doubtedly disqualify him. For all writers of authority decide that no
confidence can be placed in the w-ritings of a man who is known to have
been an enemy to those on whose affairs he writes‘. “ When an enemy is
the subject of a discreditable narrative, we must withhold our assent.’'
This is the advice of BodinuS, who adds, “ that we must be on our
guard, and not too easily eredit a writer when he panegyrizes his·
friends or vituperates his enemies. But he should have our unhesi·
tating assent when he praises his enemieS‚ and honestly admits their
noble deeds.” Polybius, a Greek, has exposed many false statements

of Fabius and Philimus, in their histories of the Punic wars. In the
pages of the former, who was a‘ Roman, all the acts of the Romans are
worthy of heroes3 while, with the latter, the Romans are unprincipled
cowardS, and the Carthaginians, his own countrymen, ·· are extolled to
the stare. . They w‘rote history on the principle of the orator, whose
chief care is to admit nothing that may be prejudicial to himself. But
the same man can never combine on the same subject the characteristic
excellencies of the historian and the orator. The RomanS, themselves,
who were ready to believe evil of their enemieS, often indulged their
prejudices by slanders deliberately invented. Not only did they shame-
fully suppress all the good deeds of the enemy, but they often attempted
to brand them with the most atrocious calumnieS, while everything cre-

consequ‘enoes, would destroy the authority hostile to his own countrymen than to the
of all the writings of Giraldus, especially Irish, nor less zealous at one time for their
of his works on Wales. He was not less subjugat-ion toEngland.—Infifc}‚ p. 2964'n. 8.
