hold on‚” to use Giraldus's words, ‘⁴ by evil spirits, and tortured the
whole night long with such dreadful pains, such torments of fire and
of water, and of all kinds so innumersble and so indescribable, that, in
the morning, scarcely 8. single breath of lise remains in their wretched
bodies? Surely these confessors must have known what Henry of
Saltery relates: “ In the time of St. Patrick‚ and in succeeding ages,
many persons entered the Purgatory‚ some of whom returned, but
others were lost.”· confessore must have been void of prudence, reli-
gion, and of reason itself, to expose christinus to such imminent danger
of death.

According to Giraldus, those who once made a pilgrimage to this
Purgatory would never again suffer such torments, unless they fell
11110 more grievous sins, which appears to insinuate that the pilgrim
acquired a patent for the commission of the most atrocious 81111188,
provided they equalled only, but did not sul-pass imeriminalty, the de-
linquency of -his former life. In other words, a parricide or more heincus
criminal, coming 0111 of that pit, may repeat the same crimes without
any sear of the tormenta of hell, if he do not fall into more grievous
sins. Now that is the acme of absurdity, if it be not exceeded by the
following: “ Rash men have sometimes had fatal experience of the hor-
rible tortures inflicted on those who spend a night in the Purgatory.”
Before the days of Giraldus, 110 111811 ever entered the pit rsshly. On
the contrary, they proceeded with the most cautious deliberation‚ “It
was a custom,” says Henry of Salteryss ‘approved by St. Patrick and
his 8888088018, 11181 110 person should be allowed to enter that Purgatory
without the license of the bishop of the diocese; the bishop ordinarily
’ dissuaded him from his project3 but, if he persevered, the bishop gave
a letter which the postulant carried to the prior of the place; again
the prior, after reading the letter, dissuades him from his project; but,
if 118 persevere, 118 18 conducted to the ebul-ch, where he devotes fifteen

there cited, does not represen nt the popular 18 1101 a vision of purgatos-y, but a dream
belief of the present day. The pilgrims in which the person saw certain earthly
