colonien. Now it happens that the number of Irish colonica nearly coincides with those
of Britain and Gaul. The Welah Triads admit four for Britain; Thierry admits three for
Gaulz while our accounts vary from three to four.

let. The Nemediane of our story are probably of that primoeval Celtic racc which first
penetrated to the western shores of Europe. The name is found in the mountains of
Auvergne, and in the Asturiam and aleo in places subsequently occupied by Gauls of the Ι
second race3 but the word is Gaelicffi-Humboldt, p. 1033 Histoire des Gauloiae, vol. i. 4
p. cxxiv. An ancient authority derives the word “ Nemed ’⁷ or “ Nimidoe ” from the
sacred wooda—“ De sacris silvarum quse nimidas vocant,” .(ibid),—a sense which is sn'll
preserved in the Iriah word nermheub, ‘⁶ a sacred wood,” or simply ‘² a wood.”—Petrie'e
&aad Towers, p. 59. 11 the Fomorians of our traditione were Phoeniciana, it is these old
Nemediana'they should have found in Ireland, and so all traditional storiee declare. The
Nemedian reign was one long and bloody war against the Fomorian piratesf-Keatz‘vffi

2nd. Two colonica next arrive, in rapid succession, the fabled Firbolga and the
Tuatha de Dananna. Admitting those invasione as a fact, however we may doubt the
name of the invadere, the' invasion of Gaul and Britain by the Cymri, about 600 years
before Christ (Histoire des Gaulois, vol. iii. p. 2), would explain the deecent of two colo-
nies in quick succeeaion on thia country about the same period. The original Gelta of
Britain, perhaps, of Gaul, would fly westward from the Cymri, as the Britona and Gaula
of later agee fled from the Romans. Those fugitive British Celts were probably the first
invadere of Iteland (i. e. Firbolgs) after the Nemedim. But as we have a distinct tra-
dition of an ancient colony of Cruithniana direct from Gaul (Iriah Nomius, p. 133), and
aa the advanced guard of Gymri conquerora of Gaul, were themselves compend, come nxty
or seventy years later, to fly with the vanquished Celts before fresh Cymri bordes (Histoire
dee Gaulois, voL i. p. 40), it accords well both with native tradition and foreign history to
admit that a colony cf mingled Celts -and Cymri, that is Ornithniana arrived in Ireland
not long after the British Celts. The Pictones were cyani-Celt, and occupied the aea
coast between the Loire and Garonne (ibid. vol. ii. p. 31), the very place from which
Irish Nennim brings the Irieh Picta. 1 have already given my reasons for believing that
the Iriana of Eire were the Cruithne, and that they must have at a remote period occupied
nearly the whole island-p. 461. Thierry ia of opinion that the Picts' were a mixedrace,
Celt and Cymri.—v0L‘ ιἸ p. cxx.

διὰ. About 200 years after the last invasion, tradition places the great colony from
Spain. It would be ridiculons to insist on coincidence of dates, but we may remark that
these 200 years, dating from the close of the· eiith century before Christ, would nearly
bring us to the conquest of Spain by the carthag-inians, an event which would naturally
compel many of the Spanish Oelts to seek new settlernente. The Ithians apparently were
Celtiberiam; the Irians, defeated and driven from Tara, built Earnania in Ulster, but, in
other quarters of the island, are found only in the mountains and boga. These two tribes
were, as far as topography and genealogy can be relied osi, the most widely diffuaed of all ⁴
Irislr tribes before the reign of Tuathal in the second century3 and, in my opinion, they l
are the Guiddil Fichti and Guiddil Cocli of the British Triade.-- Irish Nomius, p. xxxviii.
