But, on the matter of fact, Giraldus is egregiously mistaken'. Events
which had occurred many centurias ago he brings near his own time,
that the proximity might conveniently corroborate his false statement.
This.is how the case really stands. Not tw0‚ but more than 400 years
before the English invasion, and while Fiacha Dubhdrochtech, the son of
Aid Rornae, was King of Ulster‚ an enormous whale was dristed along
by the tide, and cast up on the shore in Ulster. It had three teeth of
gold, one of which was given by Fiacha as wages to some men whom he
had employed in erecting a bridge over the rivers Fersus and Menidamh;
the other two were presented to the church to make a reliquary-case,
on which the inhabitants of that country were aecustomed to purge or
bind themselves by oath. Fiacha got his surname ‘⁶ Dub-opouocec‘,”
from building bridges (for epochei: means a bridge), the ancients having
regarded the erection of a bridge· as a meritorious act of religion, and
instituted certain solemn pontifical rites to inaugurate the laying of the
foundation stone3 hence, if we believe Varr0‚ pontiffs were so called ·’
from building bridges. Fiacha, moreover, was so ardent a lover of jus-
tice, that an ox having been stolen within his territory, he made a ¹
pilgrimage to the monastery of Bangor, and voluntarily expiated in his
own person the penalty of that crime, probably because the robber had
eluded or not satisfied the vengeance of the law. Was' the whale then
an omen of a far distant event—the English invasion of Ireland—-and
not an evident present sent from Heaven to a prince whose resources‚
perhapS, were 'not equal to his piety‚ to enable him to cover his expen·‘ ’
diture, and decorate with a suitable shrine relics so highly revered by
the inhabitants of that cou'ntry? Tigernach, who died about the year
1088, states that this whale with the golden teeth was cast on shore in
the year 743, and that each of the teeth, when tested in the scales,
weighed fifty ounceS. One of them, he adds, was for a long time after
to be seen on the great altar of the monastery of Bangor. Perhaps it
had been cast into a·shrine containing the aforesaid relicS.

Having seen what slight importance is due to this first augury of
Giraldus, let us now follow him into the still more profound mysteries
of the craft, to ascertain whether no truer oracle issued from him under
the access of the Pythonic spirit: “ It is in December‚” he says, ,⁴⁶ that
wolves generally bring forth their cubs in Ireland, an omen of the hor-
rors of treachery and rapine, which pullulate precociously here.” Where
