macy W, but the Lower House of this Parliament expelled the only na·-
tive Catholic returned, because he refused to take that cath. The men,
forsooth, who often violated their own oath of allegiance to the King,
persecute those who preser'ved their allegiance, though not bound by
oath. After the change of religion in Ireland established by the Govern-
ment⁸, Catholics, certainly, were not required to take the cath of supre-
τηεογ, for a large number of them were members of all subsequent
Parliaments, and yet none of them were ever unseated for refusing the
cath of supremacy’. Even in the House of Lords ‚of this present Par-
liament‚ that cath was not tendered to the few great Catholic lords⁸.
As this departure of the Lower House from the practice of the Lords
and the precedente of our ancestors‚ betrays, unblushingly‚ the most
atrocious insolence, what fatal dangers must threaten the State, when
the representatives of the people enact innovation and revolution ἲ

“ “For,'' as St. Augustine says, “ the mere change of a custom disor-

ders, by its novelty, even the good that it effects.’'

By the articles of the same peace⁸‚ the laws formerly enacte‘d
against the catholic saith were to be a dead letter, so that the profes-
sion οἷ that same faith should not be prejudicial to the Catholics. But
this last Parliament has not only re·enacted the old statutes, but has
even poesed laws far more severe sor the total abolition of that religion ς’
so that they appear deliberately to oppose your wishes, to obstruet
your proclamatione, ιο disobey your orders, and to compel us to exclaim, ·
“ lo! this thy plighted faith.” Wishing ιο govern‚ not to be governed‚
to be Kings‚ not subjects, they have preferred that you should be crueI
in punishing‚ not generous in forgiving, in order to increase their own

the cit-ks, towns, and other communities‚
everywhere (ρουίπο) refused ιο take it, or

withdrew their children, when the College

stin continued ιο take the old catholic
cath. The hm for the‘ adoption of the
English penul lave was also thrown out in
the Irish Pariisment3 and when the pro·
