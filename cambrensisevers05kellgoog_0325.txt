Danish devastatione, found that it only fanned them into a more fearful
conflagration. For Sueno, King of Denmark, enraged at the massacre
of his friends, invaded En gland at the head of an immense army in 1012,
and, sweeping all before him with the most savage ferocity‚ subdued the
whole kingdom„ The pagans themselveS, who were never cheered by
the light of saith, were not guilty of Giraldus's cruelty. Romulus
strictly ordered quartcr to be given to persons under the age of puber-ty
in the captured cities. Well may we ask, -

“ Was ever guilt so foul‚--on savage men,
In Sinis' pirate bark, or Scyron’s crag,
Or bun of Phalaris, or Sylla’s jails?
‚Gentle the steeds of Diomede l—-clement
Busiris’ shrine l—-good Cinna i--mild Spartacus Γ·

Giraldus “ can compare with you.” -The feelings of human nature itself
are sacrificed to his hostility, of which he gives the most ferocious and
unmistakeable evidence in the delight with which he pours out a torrent
of calumnious invective on the Irish‚ verifying the words of the Psalmist:
“ Their. mouth is full of cursing and bitterness3 their feet are swift to
shed blood.’' Why should I accuse him of having violated that law of
the Church, which prohfflits an ecclesiastic to pronounce sentence of
⁶ death on any man, when he has so impiously trampled on all laws,
humanjand divine? With good reason may I ask with St. Bernard, “who
will not be astonished and shocked‚ that the same man should march in
armor at the head of a battalion, and announce the Gospel in the church,
dressed in his alb and stoleg rouse soldiers to battle with the trumpet,
and announce the orders of the bishop to the people? Will he de-

· clare that he is ashamed of the Gospel (in which the vessel of election

gloried)‚ and blushes at his state, and would think it more honorable
to be regarded as a soldier, who prefers war and the forum (and camps)
to the Church? That would be an aggravaticn of *his guilt: it would
convict him clearly of preferring things human to divine, and terres-
trial to heavenly interests.” What advantage could I gain by charging
him with having violated the duties of his order, when he takes such
trouble to instruct his countrymen in the stratagems and arts of war-
fareF‘, and advises them, ‘tthat, as soon as that people shall have bowed
its neck. perfectly to-the yoke‘, an edict, such as was published in Sicily,
