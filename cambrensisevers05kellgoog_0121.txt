be extinguished. The moment it appears, falsehoods, no matter with
what skiu a'nd labor they may have been concocted‚ melt and disap-
pear, like the morning frost under the beams of the noonday sun. For,
as time alone, without the aid of argument, often refutes and annihilatae
the lie, so truth and justice, though they may be orushed sor a time by
the violent injustice of men, must triumph in the end. The ermour of
Achilles, adjudicated to Ulysses by the unjust decision of the Greeks,
is said to have floated, after his shipwreck, to the tomb of Ajax, as if
heaven itself decreed that the rightsul claimant should get justice even
in his grave. 9‘For we can do nothing,” says the Apostle,‘ ‘against the
truh, but for the truth.”
‘ Time neither corroborates error nor invests it with the slightest
authority, and even tho'ugh it should have supplanted and obscured the

truth during several centul-ies, its old age must not impose on us, nor ⁸

extort an obsequious and credulous assent derogatory to truth. We
know, from experience that a fable ¹once circulated among the vulgar, ’
-and adorned with several additions as it passes from mouth to mouth,

the chair of St. Peter was once filled by a woman, Pope Joan3 and this
belief, spreading to every quarter of the Christian world, took firm and
undispnted hold of the minds of men-during 600 years, until it w'as at
‘length refuted and exposed by most eminent writers‚-Cardinals Baro-
nius and Bellarmine3 Robert Parsons, the J esuit3 Florimond Raimond3
and David Blondell, a man of varied erudition, as far as heresy allows
him: sopthat, both by the arguments of the defendere of the Chureh‚
and the admission of her adversaries, that question has been set for ever
at rest. No historical fact in the Office of the Church, was more cele-
brated than that which, it was said, indueed the founder of the Carthu-

”sian Order‚ St. Brimo, to prescribe so austere a rule for his mouks, It Ι

was said that he heard a Doctor of the Paris University exclaiming,

after his death, on the first dayst ‘I am accused;’' on the next, “I am ,

- been currently received during 500 years, was at length refuted by

learned authorities, and within our days has been expunged froni the

Office. Was not cardinal Batonius the first to discover, after the· lapse
