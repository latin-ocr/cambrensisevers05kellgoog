Loegaire Lol-c, after a reign of two years, was deposed and slain at A. c.
Kaunan¹⁵ by his elder brother, Cobhthach Cael, or Caolmbreagh, whom 3—00—

he had excluded from the throne, A. M. 4608.

Cobhthach Caolmbreagh next seized the helm of state. He was sur· ‚284

named Caolmbreagh to -signify the ambition that devoured him during
the life of his brother, Loegaire, so that he became pale, ehrivelled,

withered‚ and almost fleshless.

“ Caol‚” in the Irish‚ is emaciated‚

and “ Breagh” the name of the place where he lay confined constantly
to his bed. · After a reign of fifty years he was slain on the very spot
where himself had shed his brother’s blood, by Labhraidh Loingseach‚
son os Olill Aine, and grandson of Loegaire Lore, who thus, by one blow‚
avenged his father's and grandfather’s death, A. M. 4658.

Labhraidh Loingseach¹‚ recoveringm his grandfather-’s throne, reigned 267

nineteen years, during which he was exposed to constant pei-ile from
the sons of Cobhfflach, and was at length slain by Meilge‚ one of these·

sons, A. M. 46772.

Loingseach (supra, p. 446, note θ), and
none from the latter ,to Duach Daltadegha
(A. C. 48, infrd, A. M. 5031). Our author
and O’Flaherty make Ugaine great-grand-
father to Labhraidh, which clearly cannot
be reconciled with Tighernach, if his dates
A. C. 89, 63, mark the reign of Labhraidh,
and I see no reason why they do not. They
would make, it is true, two terrible gaps in
the regal line from Ugaine to Daltadegha3
but that line appears to be the most fragile
in the whole bardic chronology, as there is
a difference of not less than 195 years
(475-280) between Dr. Lynch and O’Fla-
hei-ty on the total of the teigne from Hu-
gony to Daltadegha, both included. The
difference would be considerably increased
if we compared the two lists from the acces-

sion of Cimbaoth. In such uncertainty it
is safer to conclude that Tighernach in-
tended A. C. 89, 63, as the true date of
Labhraidh3 and we know that about that ν
period the south of Britain was invaded and
subdued by Gaulsz “ Apud eos (Suessiones)
fuisse regem nostra etiam mernor-iu, Divi--
tiacum totius Gauio pots-tissimum qui cum
magnae partis harum regionum, tum etiam
Britanniae regnum obtinuerit.” - Coesar.

fers the death of Cathaoir Mor to A. D. 165.
There wo⁸uld be only 254 years for the total
of the thirty kings between Cathaoir and
Labhralidh (p. 446, note 0, supr-d), that is,
about eight years and a half each, a low
average certainly as compared with Eama-
nian kings, but only three years and a half
less than the average reigns of the Christian
kings of Ireland. Slanghe's general was a
Labhraidh Loingseach also, a rather suspi-
cions coincidence with the story of the first
Firbolg invasion.—Proley. pars ii. p. 58.
