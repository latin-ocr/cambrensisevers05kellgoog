not one have 1 found who does not either suppress truth or state false-
hood, exaggerate whatever is bad, or extenuate the glor'y of whatever ·
is good. Their common practice is, to indite, in every line, such calum·
nies against the Irish, to treet them with such insolent arrogance, as if
- they were the most degraded slaves, that their morke are rather s libel
on our country and a panegyric on their own, than a true history. In
the course of my labore I shall produce, as occasion requires, abundant
proofs of this charge; and if any unprejudiced man take the trouble of

writers hav‘e drawn be dried up, their works are refuted. For the mere
assent of e number of men, adopting the error of another, has no weight,
the lawe themselves eeressly deciding that ‘⁴ consent, founded on error,

multitude to do evil, neither shalt thou yield in judgment to the opi-

God another tower of Babel? 'More honor ’² (Ι will add, credit) “is

boasters. When you plead the number of liare, you do but declare the ἡ
extent of the evil, for the greater the number involved, the greater ·
the evil itself.” These silent voters are, therefore, of no weight, because
they bring to the cause nothing but an unsubstantial heap of verbiage,
