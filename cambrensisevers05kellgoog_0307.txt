uaNY REASONS TO PROVE THAT GIRALDUS WAS ΒΥ ΝΟ ΜΕΑΝΒ QQALIFOED TO WRITE
ΟΝ [RISH AFFAIRS.

[30] A native is better qualiued to write the history of 1118 country than 0 farcimen—The history of
Rome more faithfuily written by Dionysius of Halicarnassus than by many Roman writers.—
Giraldus did not consult 111811 authentica· and was ignorant of the Irish languine—The most cele-
bratcd historiam have fallen into 011018 through ignor-unce of languages. [31] Qualifications of
the historicae-Girumu took no paine tolcam the 111811 languaga—He neglected 011101101οῃ.-
Did not travel through all steiana—Litus respect duc to him who merely retails what he hears.

Rasnavmc sor the course of this work the more detailed evidences of
Giraldus’s flagrant violations of the duties of an historian, I shall now
endeavour to prove that in 011 those qualifications which recommend
the historian, he was miserably deficient⁸. It is a question much dc-
bated among 11111010, whether a native or a foreigner be. the better
adapted for composing the history of a nation. A foreigner‚ some main-
tain, is utterly unfit for the task3 he can know from authority only the
events which the native sees with his own eyes, A member of 0 family
can give a more trustworthy account of family events than a person
called in from the neighbourhood3 natives are better acquainted with

their own affairs than strangers, so that there ought to be little hesi-
tation in subscribing to the opinion of Lebrixa, that ‘⁶ foteigners are

unsafe guides on the history of a nation.” ‘⁶ No person‚” says Fran-

ter of Giraldus as an historian and a priest. “ been what 1 ought to be, but upon the
