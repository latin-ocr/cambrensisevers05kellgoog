for which he received from King Cormac, in reward of his distinguished A. D.

valor, as much land as he could encircle in a day’s drive in his chariot.

It was thus that Teige acquired for himself and his posterity the ter-
ritory of Triochaehed-Kianachtah, that is, the cantred of Kian’s racc,
which extended from Glasnera¹ to the hills of Maeldoid [at the Liffey],
round which he drove in the time fixed by the King. Down to the
battle in which Fergus lost his kingdom and his life, he had reigned
only one year, A. D. 225, A. M. 5425. Ι
Cormac Ulfhada having thus secured the· throne, after so many trials x

and exertions, acquired the highest reputation in arts and ame, in war '254
and learning. Tighernach writes that he was victorious in thirty-six
engagementsss. Dunlaing, King of Leinster, son of Euda N iadh, having-
dared to murder thirty royal virgine, who dwelt in the Cloenfert of
Tara, as a sacred asylum, with thirty other virgins¹, their handmaidsm‚

Ι· Dr. O'Conor, under the influence of
'the Vallancey mania, inferi-ed that these
women were Druidesses‚ and guardiam of
the holy fire, because there was a holy fire
in Kildara, and Kildare is near Tara Ξ-
Ρνοῑῳ. pars i. p. xxviii. But the state-
ment and uie consequentia are αἱ the same
character as those which aequired such un·
enviable notoriety for the speculative anti-
quarians of that school. Tighernach's words
do not imply that the occupante of the clu·
ainfeart of Tara were Druidesses3 but they
may have been, ir by that term be under-
stood a community of women like those who
are described by Plutarch, Pliny, Mela, and
Strabo, as inhabiting the island of Sena
(now Sam), off the extreme western point
of Boetagne, and another island in the es-
tuary of the Loire. Their reputation, as

prophetesses, magicians, Sto. δια, was diffu-
sed over Europe. Their rites were be-
lieved to resemble, in some points, the abo-
minable rites of Bacchus, and those -of
Samothrace ς but there is no allusion to hely
fire. These women were part of the Gaul-
ish Druidic system.— Thierry, Histoire des
Gaulane, vol. ii. p. 87, et seq. None but
women of the tribe Nannetes (alias Nam-
nitae), which occupied the country north of
the mouth of the Loire, were admissible
into the sacred, island in the mouth of that
river. N annetes, or Namnatae, is very like
the tribe Nagnatss, which Ptolemy places
in ⁴ the north-west of Ireland, occupying,
apparently, part of Westmeath‚ and other
more waetern districts, ir such a map can
Justify any conjecture. Το me it appears
that the city Rheba, the greatest on the
map, can be no other than Uisneach. It
was the central and most sacred hill in Ire-
land3 and, if we believe the recorda of
Tuathal Teachtmar’s reign, it was the
great annual mart of the kingdom, and
would thus acquire its. importance in the
eyes of merchants, from whom alone Pto-r
