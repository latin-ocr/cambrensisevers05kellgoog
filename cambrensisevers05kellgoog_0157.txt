omitting these and similar well-known wells, which he had under

his eyeS, he deliberately selects for his narrative the more obscure and
distant wells; proving, by his anxiety to chronicle the profane rather
than the sacred properties of these wella* that his aversion for the sacred
was as great as his partiality for the profane. Moreover, 'travelled fops
are emboldened to descant more fearlessly on distant objects unknown
to their auditors. Travellers (says our Irish proverb) bring home a
patent for lying; an'd since they are the principal authorities for Gerald’s
narrative, I am at a loss to know how he can be worthy of credit. His
own story ‘⁴ of the man, whom he saw with part of his heard grey from .
washing in the first-mentioned fountain‚ the other part still retaining
its natural color,” waS, ‘1 have no doubt, a 'scheme of the gwy-heard,
to exhibit his dupe’s credulity; for how could any man be so devoid of
common sense as to make himself the laughing-stock of the world, with
an ugly variegated heard, when one lotion could silver it, and save him
from ridicule? I saw beards of two colors hanging from some men’s
chins; but it was nature, and not the virtue of any well, that dyed them
with different colors. Giraldus· probably saw one of these beards, and
was persuaded (credulous man 1) by the wearer that the well had im-
parted the colors, “

· His account of the wells is followed by a very silly story, without
the least semblance of truth. Why should such virginal purity be re-

quired in the priest who said mass? The mass of a priest, who is '

ordained after the death of his lawful wife, works the same effecta cx

opem operato (as theolog-iaus say) as the mass of the purest virgin that “

ever lived. The tempests excited in the surrounding district, when any
one touched or looked at the wells must be attributed to witchcraft,
and not toa miracle3 sor Martin Delrio proveS, by the clearest argu-
mentS, that human touch or look has no such potent influence. I am
not at all surprised that mass was celebrated, and holy water sprinkled‚
