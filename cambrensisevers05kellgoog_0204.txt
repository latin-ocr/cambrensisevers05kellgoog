Hiber-nica certe lingua non est conjurationi machinandae magis apta
quam quaevis alia lingua, nec minus quam caeterae suis ornamentis est
distincta: nam adeo copiosa est, ut gravitate Hispamcam, comitate
Italicam, amoris conciliatione Gallicam, terroris incussione Germani-
cam si non aequet, modico sane intervallo sequatur. Sacer orator
Hibernicoe linguae fulmine sceleratos a flagitio saepissime deterret, ejus-
dem quoque linguae lenocinio ad virtutem attrahit. Illa inter matrices
Euiopae linguas refertur. Scaliger enim ait undecim in Europa linguas
esse matrices, Latinam, Graecam, Teutonicum, Slavicam, Epiroticam,
Tartaricam, Hungaricam, Finnonicam, Hirlandicam, Cantabricam,x et
Britannicam⁴. Linguam Hiber-nicam multa concinnitate praeditam esse
quis neget? cum eam Stanihurstus ipse fateatur acutam, sententiis
abundantem, ad acria apophthegmata, et jucundas allusiones accom-
modatam esse, addetque, in opere Latino, “ gravissimorum hominum

θ Stanihnnt thus gives tha spirit of Eng- x

lish law against tha Irish tangue: “ My

. discourse tendeth to this drift, that it is ‚not

so universally gaggled [cackled?] in the
English Pale. What brought this present
min and decay on the English of Instar?
'They were environsd and ancompassed with
evil neighbours. Neighbourhood bred ac·
quaintance, acquaintance wasted in the Irish
tongue, the Irish hooked with it attire,
attire haled rudeness‚ rudeness ingendered
ignoranda, ignorance brought contempt of
laws, tha contempt of lawa bred rebellion,
rebellion raked thereto wars3 and so, con-

Narcissus Marah at a later period, that
