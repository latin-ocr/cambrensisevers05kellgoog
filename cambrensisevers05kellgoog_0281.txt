j This name does not now exist in tim
King s County. Their territory of Tnath-

baronies of Warrenstown and Gooleetown⁹
in the cast of the King's county.

Β This ie inem-rect, because O’Murcha-
‹lhain wne never lord of all Ui-Fassghe. He
was chief of Magh-Aeife, 8 territory 811·-
joining the celebrated wood of Fidh-Gai-
bhle, now Figyle and included in the pre-
sent barony of East 0ffaly, in the county of
Kildare. Dr, Lynch should have written
the 11811188 of the families of Ui Failghe as
, follows: O’Conchobhair [now o'conor] was
prime, or chief lord of Ui Feilghe, under
whom were the following dynasta: 1, Q’Ai-
mergin, now Bergin³ lord of Tuaith· Geisille,
now the barony of Geshill3 Q, O'Duinn, now
Dunne, lord of Ui·Riagain, now the barony

Ae'nghusa, now Hennessy, of claun-Chol-
gain, now the barony of Lower Philips-

Aeife‚ 8 district in the barony of East Of-
faly‚ adjoining Tethmoy,'fand the ‘wood of

the barony of Ροτιη811111811, in which the
Castle of Leighe, now anylice Lea‚: still
preserves the name.

¹ Generany called Cairbre Ui Chiardha,
i. e. 0’ Keary’ s Carbury3 now the barony
of Carbury, in the county ef Kildare. This
is clearfsom O’ Dubhagain‚ 'who etates that
the Ui cidi-dha are the only sept of the rece
of Niall Naighiauaoli eeated in Leinster.
O’ Ciardha is now anglicised Keary and
Oarey.

¹³¹ This is incorrect.1t should be‘ ‘Mac
Eochadha in Ui-Faelain.’' Ui-Faelain was
the 1181118 of 8 tribe which, after the eete-
blishment ‚of hereditary sumamegssbranched
