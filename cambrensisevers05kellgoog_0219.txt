11181 conquered nations always adopted the dress of their conquerere,
or that such a change of dress was any test of subjugation.

Not less untruly has he asserted that, when.00nquered nations lost
their independence, they renounced their own institutions for those of
the conquerors. The contrary was a usual custom among the Greeks:

‘⁶ The Lacedemonians, and for some time the Athenians, reserved no ⁸

dominion over the captured cities.” ‘⁴ The Roman Consul granted peace
to Philip, King of Macedon, and permitted him to reign. He also re·
stored the old constitution of Greece‚ and gave her the enjoyment of her
own laws and her ancient liberty. When AntiochuS, King of Syria, was
conquered 81111 811811 sor peace, part of his kingdom was restored to him.
Pompey raised the suppliant Tigranes to a throne, for the people which
conquered kingdoms used also to give them away.” The conditione
imposed on Darius by the victorious Alexander were, that he might
reign as a king over all others, provided he acknowledged himself a
vassal of Alexander. The city os Apameae, Pliny tells 118, 11811 1118 pri-

plac'es had 111811 own magistrates and senate, such as the city of Ami<
sena in PontuS, to which Lucullus granted the use of its own lawe. The
Goths conquered the Romam, but spared their laws. ‘Even William
the Conqueror himself governed his victorious N ormans and conquered
, English by these very laws which had been in force in England long
before the conquest.” English lawe were not forced on the Welsh by
Edward 1.; but, “after a diligent examination and full review of the
Welsh laws (which in many points resembled the Irish), his decree
permitted some, amended others, and enacted some other addition‘al
constitutions :⁷² for it was not unusual to
