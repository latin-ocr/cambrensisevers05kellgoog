sons, in Lagenifi S. Brigitae puteus visitur. Ad rivulum S. Molengi,
quarto a Rosponte lapide, ad fluvium N eorium ” (Feorium potius) “ si·

Ecclesiastici, et religiosi, magnates et alii, et communiter omnes utri-

H'utory, chap. vii. sect. 11. This belief

on the Ordnance maps in the county of
Wexford alone, besides a proportional nnm-

still prevails3 but many places which, thirty
years ago, were visited by immense crowds
on the festival of the saint ¹after whom the
well was named, are rapidly lesing their
celebrity, the Catholic clergy having osten
prohibited the pilgrimages in consequence
of the abuses that followed from them.
These hely wells were generally near a
chureh, and owed their reputation often to
the fact, that the anchorite or hermit had
dwelt near them, before the disciples had
gathered around him, and enabled him to·
erect the church. For the celebrated well
of St. Augustine, near Galway, see our Ans
thor’s Dedication, οὶιρνᾶ, p. 56, and West
Counauqht, p. 88.

-ῑ John’s well, a beautiful spring in the
county of Meath‚ near Lord Dunsany’s de-

, mesne. Until within the last few years, it*

was frequented on the 24th of June by pil-
grims from Meath, Westmeath, Cavan, and
Monaghan3 bnt the Catholic clergy have
probibited the “ patron‚” because many visi-
tors came for amusement alone.

¹¹ Itis impossible to ascertain what well

of St. Brigid is alluded to here, there bei‘ng ·

at least half a dozen Brideswells marked

ber in the other Leinster connties. Colgan
( Trina Reum„ p. 644, n. 44) mentions
three wells, which were probably the most
celebrated in his time= ‘⁴ One in the county
of Roscommon‚ not far from Athlonefwhich
was frequented from all quarters, not only
by catholice, but Protestants· also, on ac-. 1
count of the wonderful things said to· have
been performed there. So great was its
fame, that Randal M‘Donald, Earl of An-
trim, surmunded it with a strong wall of
hammered stone. There were two other cele-
brated wells, one in Thomond and another
in Hy-Kinsellagh, which probably is that
mentioned by Rothe. The peasanny still
point out St. Bridget‘s ehair and headstone
at Brideswell, Kilranelagh, Upper Talbots-
town, county Wicklow. The work of Da:
vid Rothe, cited in the text, is not known
to the Editor. ’

' There are three wells of St. Moling. The
well of Listerlings about three, and that at
Craon MoHng, called Mullinyahill, about
six miles from Ross3 but the principal well
is at St. Moling's Monastery, called, aster
him, St. Mullin's, which gives its name to
a barony in the county of Carlow. This
