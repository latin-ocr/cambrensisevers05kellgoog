f Now Denegan. This family was seated
at Ballydonnagan and Rhinodonnagan, in
the barony of Beate, in the extreme south-
western part of the county of Cork.

&The lord of Cerea-Duibhne was O'Falvy.
—See note θ, p. 272, ευρνὰ. According to
O’h-Uidhrin, O’Bilre was one of the dy-
> nasts of Ui-Oonaffl-Gabhra.

¹¹ This is intended sor Mac Indeirghe‚ now
Mac Eniry3 but it is not correct, as O’Do-
novan was usually the chief lord of all the
Ui-Fidhgeinte3 but he was sometimes set
aeide by O’Cleircin, now O’Cleireahoain‚
and by O’Kinealy‚ O'Ooileain‚ and O’Flan-
nabin-a, families that dwindled into sarmers
and oottiers several centuries sinee- ΟἸ)ο-
novan and O’Coileain, now Collins, were
driven from the plains of Ui-Fidhgeinte,

in the twelfth centur->⁷3 but Mae Eniry re-
mained in his original territory of Col-oa-
Muiohet, now Corcomohid, in the south of
the county of Limerick‚ where he erected a
monastery, and was possessed of a eonsi-
derable estate up to the period of the re-
volution.--See Archdall's Monasticon Hi-
ber-uicum, p. 419, where, under the head
of Casnffrown Mac Eril-ntur, in the ba·
rony of Conello, formerly the seat of Mae
Eniry ArchdaII writes, οι· rather quotes
from O’Halloran: ‘⁶ Here we find the ruins

⁹ of a very large monastery, and soine other

public buildings, which sufficiently evince
the piety‚ dignity‚ and splendour of that
ancient family.” — See nobe ¹¹, p. 271, su-
Ρνὰ. Dr. Mae Eniry, P. P. of Tralee‚ is the
most distinguished, man of this family now
in Ireland.

¹ According to O'h-Uidhrin and Reating‚
O’Brie was lord of the southern Deisi, now
Decies, in the oounty of Waterford.

Ι* This is erroneous. O'Floinn was lord of
Musoraidhe Mitine, and O’Donnagain and
O'Culleannain were lords of M usoraidhe
Tri-Maighe—-See note f, p. 276, supra.
