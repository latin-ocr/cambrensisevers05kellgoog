carried by individua} valor, or the assistance of others. He was the
first in the field, and generally the last to hear the signal to retreat.
In every engagement his spirits were wound up to conquer 01· perish.
He was so impatient and enthusiastic, that, to him, nothing was hono·
rable except the instant attainment of his object, or the close of his
mortal career. He knew no medium between the laurels of Mars and
of the tomb3 and so ambitione was 110 of fame and glory, that 'if he could
not win them by a brave life, he was 'ready to die for them.’' But when
Giraldus grew tired of belaboring individuale with his eulogies, he crowds
all his canvass, and, mustei-ing them in groups before him, at length ex·-
claimS, as if arrived safely in port: “ Ο race 1 O nation l--combining
the qualities of two different natures,--your courage you have from
the Trojans³‚ the use of arms from the Gauls3 Ο racel Ο tribe! your
own prowess alone could conquer any kingdom.'’ The wonder is he did
not say, “ they were gods by both sides,” He then proceeds in a dif-
fuse strain to descant on the merits of the Geraldines‚ bon-owing a
rhetorical figure from the prince of orators, to strike home with more
vigor. “Who burst into the heart of the enemy’s strongholds ⁸?-the

ἶ ’ Geraldines. who are the terror of the enemy ?-the Geraldines, the

Geraldines. If my songs ‘avail, your memory is immortal.'’

This is not an historian but an orator, launching out from the des-
tined course of 1118 narrative, into elaborate panegyrice on his friends.
N ay, he plays the poet, and⁴ boasts-that he will enrol their deeds in
honied rhyme. This circumstance alone should impeach his veracity4
‘because he is witness in his own cause, and the laws themselves declare
that such a witness is not to'be admitted in evidence. It is clear that
Giraldus was a witness in his own cause, or, what comes to the same, that
he was closely allied to the persons whom 110 overwhelmed with those
eulogieS. David Powell‚ in his notes to the ‘⁴ Itinerary of Cambria‚” Δ
states that “ N esta, daughter of Rufus, Prince of Demetiak, was distin-
guished as the most beautiful woman of her day. She bore a son,
Henry, to ' Henry the First‚ King of England. Afterwards, with the
consent of the King, she was married to Gerald of Windsor‚ and, from
this marriage, Maurice Fitzgerald‚ and' all the Geraldines of >Ireland‚ are

now called Pembrokeshire, where a colony diately after the Norman conquest—See
of Not-mans established themselves imme- Thierr‘y's Nou-man Conquest.
