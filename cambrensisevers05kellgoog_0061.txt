= “ The government of the Commonwealth,” says Cicer0‚ “ must be
conducted for the interest οἷ’ the governed, not the governors.” How,
then, can members of Pax-liment, not chonen by natives, have any re·
gard for native interests? Will they not rather exert all their influence
to exalt those who gave them seats in Parliament ἰ’ Have they not
already pronounced the natives universally guilty of treason, and pressed
you, in the most importunate way, not to pardon that crime, but to
punish it by the confiscation of the hereditary native estates? Mithri-
dates οι· Hannibal, I am confident, did ¹not hate the Romans more cor·
diany than those men hate the Irish. They have excluded the Irish,
alone, from tasting of that bounteous stream of mercy which welled
stom your beart, and-lavished its favors indiscriminately. They should
have known that “he shall have judgment without mercy who has
shown no mercy 3„ and-that, in the words of Cicem, ‘⁶ do not par-deff is
an expression ‘⁴ not sor a man, nor to a man.” But since the stain of a
much more foul rebellion rests not slightly but deeply on themseka,
it is revolting to common sense that men, who owe their own lives to

offences; if it b'e not that they use the same arts to³ estrange your affec-
tione from us, which his counsellors employed to inflame the hatred of
Artaxerxes against the J ewS. In the words of these counsellorS, it
would se'em, they address you: “ Ireland is rebellione, and hurtful to
the kings and provinceS, and wars were raised therein of old time.”
But you imitate DariuS, who gave a deaf ear to the complaints of his
κ courtiers, and loaded the Jews with his' fax'rors3 for, perceiving that

the accusatione of our enemies are groundless, you are inclined, οι· rather ,
condescend, to extend great indulgence to ηε. '⁶

N ever, most clement Prince‚ shall those men pervert you from your

natural clemency to cruelty. The greatness of clemency is always esti· ,

mated by the heinousness of the forgiven guiltJ„ But, as you have
already pardoned them the most atrocious crime ever committed within
the memory of man, as only a few have b'een punished, and these merely
on the principle that impunity should not increase crime, that all should ’
