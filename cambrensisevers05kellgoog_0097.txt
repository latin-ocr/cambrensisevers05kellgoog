would be a source of endless discord in your dominionsz but the wis·
dom of King Jamae gives a different decision. “ History,” he says,
‘⁶ is fun of examples of churohes flourishing under' a king of a different
creed;” an opinion confirmed by your father, King Charles, of blessed
memory, who asserta, in his admirable meditatione, that he was annoyed
on finding that ‘the Papists were more zealous in their allegiance than
many professing Protestants, who appeared to have imbibed the norst

· principles of the worst class of Papists. But, with regard to the loyalty

of the Irish Catholics ιο their Kings, I have already demonstrated, that

“ Ireland¹ in trying times has ever shown,
Inviolable sealty ιο the throne.”

Your Majesty must have been persuaded of the loyalty of Irish
Catholics, when, both in your “ Declaration‚” and in various other
public documentsi‚ you restored ιο their former estate all “ innocent

. Papists,” that is, those who were guilty of no other crime but their

creed. N ay, the catholic religion· is not only consistent with loyalty
to our King, but, moreover, with the eternal salvation of our souls,
even according to our adversaries themselves. Hem-y IV„ King of
France, is said to have asked a certain minister, whether the way to
heaven was open to a Papist ? “ YeS,” was the reply; “ the Papists
take a circuitous path, but the Reformists the straight road to heaven.”
‘⁴ Then,” said the King, “ the religion of the Papists is more safe, as
both parties agree that its professors can go ιο heaven, while only one
party asserts, and the other denies, that the professors of our’s can go to
heaven.” Many Protestant doctors are quoted in the Apology of the
Protestants, as teaching that the profession of the catholic saith is not
an obstacle ιο any man’s salvation3 and this opinion is maintained by
George Abbot, predecessor of William Laud in the archbishopric of
Canterbury, in the first argument, first section, of his Answer to Hill.
There is also a common saying of the people‚ that they could not be so
uncharitable to the Catholics as to deny the possibility of their eternal
salvation, and that on this very point the Catholics show their unchari—
tableness‚ by not holding a similar opinion of the professors of the re-
formed religion. Since, then, the Catholic faith is no obstacle to the
peace of the Commonwealth, nor to the salvation of souls, we earnestly
implore your MaJesty that men shall not be punished for professing it:
