The Irish language, certainly, has no peculiar aptitudo for treason-
able machinatione, nor is it devoid of characteristic excellencies: sur-
passing in gravity the Spanish, in elegance the Italian, in colloquial
char-m the French, it equale, if it does not surpass, the German itself
in inspiring terror. From the lips of the Irish preecher it is a holt to
arrest the evil-doer in the career of guilt, and to allure, by its soft and
insinuating tones, to the pathe of virtue. It is one of the original lan· »
gunges of Europe. Scaliger mentions elevent Latin, Greek, Teutonic,
Sclavonian, Epirote, Tartar, Hungarian, Finnish, Irish, Basque, and
Welsh¹. But ean there be any doubt of the excellencies of the Irish,
when Stanihurst himself admits thet it is sententious and expressive,
and a good vehicle for the keen apophthegm and the delicate allusion?

He, compares the different dialects of the
Welsh, especially the pure North Welsh,
and the still more polished Ceretican in the
hear-t of south Wales. Extending his re-
sesrches, he finds that the Annon-ioan of
Bretsgng and the British of Commu, are
almost the same (“ fiere persimiles '')‚ and
that both are almost, in all respecls, intel·
