- their piety. At present Ι proceed to give the succession of the kings
of Ireland‚ that their names, at least, may be rescued from that obli-
vion to which Giraldus sought 'to consign them. 1 shall also give the ¹
dates and duration of their reigns, together with a brief sketch of some
of the most striking events, which either excite admiration by their
singnlarsty, or pleasure by their novelty, or laughter by their absur-
dity, or a noble emulation by their grandeur, or a hatred of vice by their
heincusness. This plan will supply the loss of that catalogue which
Gir-aldus suppressed3 it shall also serve as a crushing rebuke of his im-
pudent. calumny, “ that the Irish kings did nothing worth notice.”
Of this I am thoroughly convinced‚ that, had their lives been stained
by, any strange or unheard-of crime, Giraldus would not have failed to
produce it; his resolve to defame the nat'ion being so inveterate that he
had not the kindness to give her even the poor pleasure of finding a
catalogue of her kings in a work which teems with odious calumnies
against all her sons· .

The leaders of the primitive settlersb in Ireland did not take the title
of king before the descent of the Firbolgs⁰ in the year 1056“1 after the
Deluge. Slane, or Slainge, was :the first Firbolg king. For, as Gi-
raldus writeS, ‘⁶ Slane alone obtained the monarchy of all Ireland‚
whence he‘ is styled the first king? One year after his succession he
lost his kingdom and his life, and his name is still given to the river
Inverslaness, which washes the base of Slieve Slange, near Lecale, in
the county Down. It was during his reign that Ireland was divided
into those provinces which are yet preserved. The fact is commemo-
rated by Giraldus: ‘⁶ Ireland was anciently divided into five nearly
equal parte, name153 the two Munster8‚ North and South, Leinster,
Ulster, and Connaught‘.'’
