⁸ This should not have the· O‘ prefixed,
for the name ie Mag, or Ma'c Laohluinm
or O'Laohluinn‚ as the Four Masters some-
times wri’te it. This family sunk under the
O'Neills in the thirteenth century. They
are still very numerous in the barony of
Inishowen, county of Denegal. ⁸
⁸ Ι· That is, Cinnaehta-Glinne-Geimhim
now the barony of Keenaght, in the eounty
'of Londonderry. D'Cathain, now O’Kme.
We have a sfr Robert and a Sir Richard of
this rane st present. Sir Richard Cane, ofthe
oounty of waterford, is not of the o’ceins of
the River Haben, in that oounty, but of the
Ulster family of cianachta Glianne Geim-
hin. His grandfather, who was an Ulster
attanay, settled in the city of waterford.
‘Now O'Gonor. This is a mistake of
Dr. Lynch’s. O’Dubhagin says : ‘⁴ The
fair king of (Ranaehta, of the raee of va-
lorous Eoghan‚ ie O’Cathaim but O’Con-
ebobair of the raee of Tadhg, son of Cian of
cniseal, was its first king.’' 'The O'Conors
m stin in this barony.
Β This tribe of the O’Gairmleadhaighs or
O’Gormleyu, originally seated in the barony

of Bephoe, in the present eounty of Done-

gal, but being driven out by the Cineal
onnam they established themselves on the
east side of what is now called the River
Foyle. On an old map of Ulster pre·
eefved in the spate-Paper& Office, london,
O'Gormley's country is shown as extending
from near Deru-y to Strabane. ,

¹ These tribes were eeated in the present
barony of Dungannon‚ in tho eeunty of
Tyrone. Munter-Birne, which is stin the
name of a da'etriet and Presbyter-hh ραι-ἰὼ,
is shown on αις old map of Ulsoei· in the
State Papere' office, as adjoining 'Irongh
in the oonnty of Monaghan.—See Annulo

These sumames are, now anglicised Freel, .

Donnellan, Donegan, Mac Murragh or Mae
Mon-ow, Duncan, and Μαι-οη or Rogers.
These families, who are of the great raee of

’ Eoghan‚ son of the monareh Nian of the

Nino Hostages, are now poor, and reduoed
to cottiers or small sarmere-
