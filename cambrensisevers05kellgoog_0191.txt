with the Picts and Scots. claudian, in the above-cited poem, repre-
sents Britain as dreeding elike the Scots, the Saxone, and the Picts3
and in another they ere represented as defeated in the same engage-
ment. These conjectures are confirmed by the words of Bedet “ The
Saxone and Picts waged war against the Britons, and were put to ssight
’ by an alleluia, thrice repeated.” Though some persons are of opinion
that “ Scots’' should be substituted for ‘⁶ Saxons,” some of the’Saxons or
Angles‚ who were invited to Britain under vortigern, A. D. 490, must,
at that period, have formed a settlernent in Man, otherwise they could
not have been expelled from it by Bnaden·. If pagane had been masters
of the island, who can believe that so many Christian bishops could
have freely exercised their ministry there? After the death of St. Ger-
manus‘, the first Bishop of Man, A.. D. 474, Connidrius and Romulus!
were appointed, and aster them St. Machaldush. Then came St. Conan

· and St. Mochonna¹‚ bishops of the same see. It must have been, there-

identity of the names is rendered more pross
bable‚ as colgnn (n. 9, p. 60) does not mark

, ¹Colgan (Aeta sanct„ p. 60, n. 9) states
that, besides the two bishops in the text,

there were many other Irish bishops of
Man3 bnt he produces no authorities, nor
isit possible to make out the sumssion of
prelates previous to the year 1050 (ein), at
which the Chronicle of Man commences.
On eonmus he has a note, which makes
it doubtful whether the two bishops Con·
nanus and Mochonnus were not different
forms of the same name: “Conna, aliae
Mochonna, orDochonna, called inlr-ish, by
Marion German, ‘Conna’ or ‘Cond23' hy
the Martymlogy of Tallaght ⁸ Dochonna '
and ‘Teochondm’ and by others generally
‘Machonnn’ or ⁴ Mochonda.’ ” The pre-
fixoemo agad oo‚.“inim” md “chine”
were osten incorporated with the names of
Irish saints- The diminutive of affection or
reverence οδ, anciently 00, was also suffixed
to the names,'which‚ in this case, would
produce ‘⁸ Mooonoe‚” and thus identify Con-
nanus and Mochonoc, as in the name “ Mai-
doc,’' *patron of Ferus, which is literally

in the Martymlogies. But was Gonnanus
Bishop of Man or of Inis Padraig, now Hohn
Patrick ⁸? The Annulo of Ulster‚ A. D. 797
( O’C'onor), record the plundering of his
shrine by the Danes3 and Dr. O'Conor un-
der-stands the reference as made to Holm
Patrick. But Oolgan provee (Aeta Senot„
p. 60) that Inis Padraig was the Irish name
of the see which the British writers call
Sudor. The tradition of the Isle of Man

χ claims St. Patr-ich as its apostle3 but all

his biographers, except J oeelin, are silent
‘on the subject, though they record his so-
jonrn sor a short time et ‘⁶ a very small

’ island,'’ which ingenerally understood to be

‘Helm Patriek‚ near the Irish coast. There
was “ a very small island‚” called Inis Pa-
draig (chron. Μαηπίω, p. 10; Johmone),
near Peel, on the eastern coast of the Isle
of Man. It is now connected with the main-
land. Itis covered with ecclesiastical ruins,
among which, ir we can believe a late writer '
