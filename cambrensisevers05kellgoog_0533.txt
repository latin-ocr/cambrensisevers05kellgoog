should also be stand, that among the characteristica which, according to Humboldt
(p. 145), distinguished the Spanish Oelta from the Gauls, some apply to Munster, and to
no other part of Ireland. Nothing but a careful collation οἳ the ancient Irish manuscripts
with the learned works of continental scholars, can decide this question3 nor is it my
intention to contend for more than a probability.

⁴ The claime of the Ithians to be regarded as the ancient Spanish colony, must rest on
the fact, that Ptolemy places the Spanish tribes in the southern territory, attributed by tra-
dition to the Ithians in the second century3 that Ith, according to all accounts, preceded
his Milesias brothton in inland, and appropriated to his own descendants the name Dea-
gad, which (Deagath) was the name oss one of the principal progenitors of the Milesian
family—[rich Nauius, p. 237. It is written Oeae-ct (p. 239), which, in sound at least,
and nearly in orthography‚ is identical with Dea, the name of a people in the south of
. Gaul, and with the Deobriga, Deobrigulm of the Spanish celts.-Humboldt, pp. 84, 94.
Ith’s father, Breogan, grandson of Deagath, and traditionary conqueror of Spain, be·-
qneathed his name to the richest of all the Muskerries, MuskerryrBreogan, the ‘⁶ golden
vale‚” situated in the south-west of the eounty of 'lipparam-Book of Riyhts, p. 45.

The traditional story of the Eiberians is more perplexed, and the position of their
territories more inexplicable, than those of any other branch of the Milesian family. The
usual story is that Eiber took the south of Ireland, that his descendants were subsequently
confined to North Munster, wh'ich they held until the Deagaidh invasion, when they were
driven to the western shores. But, recovering strength gradually, they obtained exclu-
sive possession of all Munster under Mogh Nuadhat and Olill Olum, and compelled Con
of the Hundred Battlesto give them the southern half of Ireland, A. D. 192, 237. · J udg-
- ing from topography alone, §we should incline to believe that the Eiberians preceded the
Eiremonians‚ and were severed by the Iffremonian invasion into two great sections, one
forming the northern line of the present Leinster, stretching from Dublin and Drogheda
to the Shannon, and occupying a strong position in north-east Connaught (p. 471, n. ξ,
snpra), the other co-extcnsive with the greater part of north Munster, and having no
connexion with the Leinster branch, except through the Delvins of the King’s County: so
that the whole family presents the appearance of an irregular semicircle in the centre of
the island, But if we consult genealogy, the inference would be, on the contrary, that
the Eiberians were later than the Eiremonians, and were, like them, nelgae. lst. Irish
Nennius, p. 259, mentions no Eiberian family which does not descend either from Mogh
Nuadhat, or his son Olill Olum. 2ndly. Some of these are expressly called Firbolg.-

hardly differed, if at all, from'Firbolg in name—Saluti, p. 471, n. ¹¹. 4thly. Several
remarkable names in the genealogy of Mogh Nuadhat (Oyyyia, p. 145> have a suspicions
resemblance to names in the genealogy of the widely extended and ancient Ithian family, Ι
such as Dearg, Dergineus, Maeniadus‚ ao. 8ιο. (Oyyq. p. 149); as if the Eiberians adopted ⁸
the most distinguished progenitors of the race whose territories they seized. 5thly. About
