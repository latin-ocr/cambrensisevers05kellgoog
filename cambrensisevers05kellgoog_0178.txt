plain that the Hebrides were Irish islanda
The Irish was spoken in the isles of Erisca,
Lewis, Rona,Arra.n, Kilda, Sto. Manuscripts,
in the Irish lang-uage and character, copies
of vicenus, Averroes, J oannes de Vigo;
Bennardus Gardonus, and several volumes
of Humentes, were found there. On the
island of Rona was a chapel dedicated to
the ·Irish St. Ronan- The names of churches

thence to those islands—p. 152. See Dr.

¹² This reasoning of Dr. Lynch is solid
against cambrensis, who discusses, at great
length, the exemption of Ireland from veno-

mous animals, but does not state that they
could not exist in the same country with
Irishmen. ‘⁶ of the various kinds of rep-
tiles there are none but harmless ones in
Ireland3 it is free from all poisonous ani·
mals, from serpents and snakes, from toads
and stogs, from tortoises and scorpione, and
from dragous. It has spiders, lesches, and-
lizards3¹ but they ars hsrmless. Hence it
may be said, with as much trnth as ele-

opinion that it was st. Patrick had banished
the reptiles, because historiam, before the
birth of St. Patricia, had asssroed Ireland's
exemption from them ε “1 am not asto-
