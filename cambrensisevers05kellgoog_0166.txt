⁰ The accounts regarding the form of
the cave, prior to the sixteenth century,
do not agree in details. According to an

chester, from whose relation Saltery com-
piled his account. Saltery, it is true, states,
os the two Irish abbots whom he consulted,

one declared the soldier’s account was true,
aud even the bishop of the diocese told him
‘⁶ that many perish in that Purgatory, and
even those who return pine away because
of the great tormenta they suffered.” This
proves that, when Saltery was writing, the
cave was known as a place of penance3 but
as an Irish abbot τηε ignorant of its exis-
tence, -as the canons of St. Augustino, to
whom the cave was intrusted, were not
established in Ireland before the twelfth
century (Lam'yau, vol. iv. p. 104),—and
as the authors of the day could not agree
whether it was Patriclt the Apostle or Pa-
trick the Abbot, iu the eighth century, who
had discovered the Purgatory ( Uesker, Aa·
riq. 465)‚--it is not rash to conclude that
Lough Derg owed its fame, and its conneri-
ion with St. Patrick, to the soldier Owen
Ι and his contemporaries. The lake does not

μ appear to have attained, before the six-

teenth century, an importance as a place of
pilgrimage for the native Itish, commensua
rate with its Europeau reputation. O’Sul-
livan states (Hist. Cata„ p. 14) that he
had s'eenin Irish ahistoryofall the visits
to the Purgatory, but this history is now
unknown. For its great fame on the Con-
tinent and in Ireland, subsequent to the
sixteenth century, see note ί, p. 150.

old English metrical version, it was closed
“with a dore bowden [bound] with iron and
stele,—and lokke and key made thereto
that no men should the dore undo.” Proie-
sart’s pilgrims 'descended down as into a
cellar3 the Dutch monk was let down into
a very deep pit by a rope (Βοῑῑαηάἰετε,
March 17, p. 6903 W riykt's Purqatory,
pp. 66, 139); but, from Lombard's Com-
mentary (p, 27⁷), it appears that though,
in his day, the cave (if he speak of the old
one) was almost level with the ground,
having been filled up atdifferent times by
order (tradition said) of bishops and Popes,
yet it had formerly been of immense depth.
But neither in Henry of,Saltery, nor in any
subsequent writer, is there any allusion to
the nine pits mentioned by Giraldus.

These nine pits were probably the sta·

’tions or “ lecti poenosi ” of the writers of the

sixteenth century and of the present day.
