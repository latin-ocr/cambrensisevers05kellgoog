Cormac was so incensed nt this horrid crime, that he cut off, one after A. D.

another, twelve kings of Leinster, and ordei-ed the levy ot' the Boru· ”’”’”

mean tribu te srom the revenues of Leinster. Thus the Lagenians paid

a. heavy penalty for their atrocious crime and treasonable violation of

the royal rights. Cormac was also victorious in some bat‘tles against

the Consciens; four times he defeated the men os Munster, and five times

the men of Ulster‚ whom he forced to take refuge in the Isle of Man,

and hence he was named Ulfadha, because he expelled the Ultonians2.
Kenting gives the following account of the learning and institutions

of Cormac⁰: “ Cormac surpassed in knowledge all his predecessore on

the Irish throne ; he composed a work on the education ofa princep, sor the

use of his son, Carbry, and established, for the good government of the

kingdom, many very useful laws, which are still preserved in works on

Irish jurisprudenoe⁹1 of all his predecessore, none equalled him in

bounteous hospitality‚ or in the munificence with which he supported

his numerous household. Not less than 1150 servants' attended him

Irish forms of the same word would allow.
Innes, who reasons with great force and
truth against the supposed eastern ori-
gin of the Irish alphabet, Bethluisnom and
maintains that Ireland derived her letters
from Christiane, did not venture to deny
the use of Ogham by the Pagan Irish. Still
it must be admitted that no Ogham inscrip—
tion of undoubtedly Pagan origin has yet
been discovered. - See Mr. O‘Donovan’s

Irisla Grmmar, p. xlvii.; and Petrie’s ’

Itouna Towm osli-elaad, p. 82. But 1
believe the sanie can be said even of the
Druidic literary remains ot· Gaul, yet it is
certain that the Greek characters were used
there by the Celts. ·

Ρ Τὴίιῌνοιῆι attributed to Cormac is still
extant. It was read to each king at his
accession to the throne, and thus might re-
tain some of its original features, embel-
lished, no doubt, by the additions of later
nges-Petrie's Tam Hill, p. 15.

*ἱ Meny of those laws attributed to King

Cormac are extant, scattered through dif-
ferent libraries in the empire. If the au-
cient history of that Celtic race, which over· ·
spread Europe from the mouth of the Danube
to Gibrait‘ar, and figured in tho most stir-
ring epis-odes of the Greek and Roman em·-
pires, be an object of interest, the publica-
tion of those Irish laws should be one of the
most valuable aids that an individua] or a
government could give for the elucidation
of the ancient history of Europe. In Franco
they would have been published centurioe
ago3 but &nemen—twentieths of the French
are Celts, and glory in their descent (wlier-
ry, Hiaet. des Gauloie, vol. i. p. x.) 3 whereas
our learned vulgar, with the history of ever-
powerful Franee before them, find, in the
irreclaimable impet-sections of Celtic charac-
ter, a solution for all moral, social, and po-
litical enormities.—See chap. xx. p. [157],
infra, which treats of the old Irish laws.

r May not the thirty virgins mentioned
above, have been daughters of Cormac?
