CHAPTER VI.

GIRALDUS WAS SUB-11:01· To MANY VIOEs, UTTERLY BEPUGNANT TO THE QUALITIES
OF A HISTORIAN.

[42] Giraldns a turbulent mm-mngloua—-Addieted to augum—An admirer of Merlln. [43] “ Pro·

Ι brought forth their young in winter, types of the rapacity of the English. not of the Irlsh. [46] The
English seized all the lands of their Irish adherents.—Varlous and contradictory interpretamus of
omma—Glraldm attaches a superstitious power to wednesdays.-Bellcved in lucky and unlncky
days. [47] Destlny an empty sound.-Pagan prayer of ernaldus—A false effleacy falsely ascribed
by Gli-aldus to nra—He appears to sanction soothsaying.-—Hls blasphcmles against the cnurch and
the saints—Brief recapitulation.

I'r is the unanimous opinion of those who prescribe rules for composing
a history, that the historiari should not be a—turbulent man, but mild,
sedate, honest, grave, prudent, modest, and of the best character; but
Giraldm possessed none of these, or the other g‘ood qualities of an histo·
rian.' He was theslave of the opposite viceS, as any reader must clearly
see, if he follows attentively the course of my work. That he was of
turbulent and morose temper is sufficiently evident from the fact, “ that
many nobles of the. highest rank in the Court were his enemies⁸;” and
so odious was he to the Welsh that he threw himself completely into·
the society of the English, though they also disliked him, because he
was a native of Walesb. Thus, like another AristarchUS, he. would
appear to have raised his censor’s rod against the world, or to have

Wales‚ th an all the Welsh princes and tribes
together. But, if we believe Giraldus him-
self, the Welsh were not at any time sin·
cerely attached to him. The Canens of St.
David, he says, elected him, because they
knew they had no chance of obtaining the
royal confirmation of a pure Welsh bishop,
and therefore they selected Giraldus, who
was of mixed Norman and Welsh blood.
Hence, he says, when the see of St. David‘s

became vacant a third time during his life,
he received no votes from the Canens (see
note 8,, p. 344, infra), because there was
then some liberty of election established by
the labors of St. Thomas of Canterbury and
his successors. This neglect irritated Giral-
dus, and infused into his already severe re-
flections on the Welsh- all the ‹fenam-ioue
acrimony ofwounded pride and disappointed
