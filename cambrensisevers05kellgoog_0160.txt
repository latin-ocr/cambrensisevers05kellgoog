ac precationibus incantamenti quidpiam tanquam venenum inspergere,
Ι ιιι latentius noceant. Sed imbres isti per praestigia inducti, praestigiis
arceri non debuerunt. Nam Delrio praestantissimis documentiS, et pro·
batissimorum Theologorum judiciis allatis, maleficium maleficio trudi
diserte negat quando malum fieri non debet, ut inde bonum eveniat²⁰.
Itaque vix dubito quin Giraldus hanc telam de industria ideo texuerit
ut Ecclesiae Hibernicae authoritate superstitionem publicitus exerceri
doceret, et cleri disciplinae hanc infamiae notam inureret. Verum Ec·
clesiam Hibernicam optimis institutis per ea tempora sic excultam fuis‘se,
infra fuse monstrabQ ut tam sordida labes tum in eam cadere non po-
tuerit. Plurima quoque Giraldi ejusdem in ipsos sanctos irreverentiae
documenta posthac: modo unum dabimus„ huic loco maxime accommo-
datum, quod in locorum descriptione versemur:

5 If Giraldus, by these stoi-ies, intended stripping of its flesh the right shoulder of
to defame the Irish chureii, and not merely a ram, and inspecting it, co'uld tell all

indulge his taste for the marvellons, he has
lert in his other writings abundant grounds
for accusing his own land. In the Itinerary
οἰ Wales (p. 844), he gives an account of
a priest who, when a boy, was carried off by

the long, yellow—haired fairies, and learned·

their language, which was a dialect of the

Greek. This story Gir-aldus had from Da· x

vid 11„ Bishop of St. David’s, who heard
it from the priest himself. In chap. xvi.
r of the Description of wales, he descrifies a
racc of prophete, who, when consulted, were
agitated and tortured like men possessed:
their first answers were incoherent3 but
the true revelations generally came ιο them
in (Imauus, in which they said they had re-
ceived into their mouths milk or honey‚

· or paper. They invoked in their rhapsodies

the name of 6οᾱ and 'the Trinity. These
prophets, who ’were found in Wales only,
were, he maintains, of the same kind as
Balaam and the Sybils. Again (ibid, p.
849), the Flemish settlcrs in Wales, by

things past, future, and present, however

‘remote the signs of war and peace, &e διας

and yet Giraldns gives the highest charac-
ter of the Flemish. It is manifest that he
intended to be Just, if not complimentary,
ιο· the Iri'sh, in many passages which are
interpreted hy Dr. Lynch as calumnious.

ring 600 years in the literathre of mediaeval
Europe, and still frequented as a place of
pilgrimage. In our notes on this'subject¹
the first place must be given ιο Thomas
Wright, M. A„ F. S. A. In his St. Pa-
trick’s Purgatory (London‚ 1844), he gives
a long account of the various works on
that subject published on the Continent,
and especially of a French work by a nan-
ciscan‚ Frgpcis Bouillon, which was very
popular dffi‘ing the first half of the last cen-
tury‘. Mr- Wright ‘⁶ describes that book
chiefly to show the kind of religious infor-
mation which was spread among the mid-
