rivalled the virulence of Anacharsis, when expelled from the society of
’ men. Staniburst says that Giraldus was “ calumnious,” and the very
titles of his works evince a decided propensity ιο invective. For he wrote
‘⁶ The Triennials‚ Ἰὼ. 1.;’' ‘⁶ On the Delinquencies of the CistercianS,
libss1.;” “Ans'wer to my Adversaries‚ lib.1.:” as if it were not enough
to glut his rapacious appetite for slander during life, without bequeath-
ing ιο posterity monuments of the scathing powers of his pen⁰.

These traits of character-might not be so repulsive had he not evin-
ced an extraordinary passion for litigation. ‘⁴ The greater part of his

life was spent in a controversy with Hubert, Archbishop of Canter- ·

bury, regarding the metropolitan rights of the church of St. David’sd.
Hence his name became notorious in Roman decretals.” That man

second vacancy of that see in 1198, hewas
again elected, but the election was contested
by the English party and Crown. A se-
cond scrutiny took place in Normandy‚ in
which the Canens gave no votes for Giral-
dus, and this fact appears ιο have changed
entirely his views of Welsh patriotism and
chnrch liberty. For, finding that he had
no chance of success, after a long contest
of five years defending his own election‚ he
strongly advised the justicias-ies not to al-
low any Welshman to be elected3 he pro·
poeed two Normans as eligible candidates3
and when the Canens of St. David privately
waited on hm, and begged him ιο support
one of several Welshmen whom they pro-
posed, he sternly refused, because they, the
Canens, had excluded him in'the election
in Normandy: ‘⁴ Memor nominationis quam
ipsi fecerant in Rormannia a quii tam facile

seipsum excluserant.”-Ibid. p. 607. Βιιι -

this resolution was as brief as it was selflsh.
He reconsidered it, and, reflecting that the
Welsh were not worth fighting for, that at
least he had-had the satisfaction οι· defeating
his most bitter enemies, and that his rIval
had never offended him personally‚ he with-
But

to these may, perhaps, be added another
motive not more creditable‚ and more effi-
cacious. Giraldus resigned his Archdea-
conry, which, by a previous compact, was ιο
be confer-red on his nephew, who was then
a child3 the Archbishop of Canterbury, at
the request of Giraldus, having so arranged
the matter with the new Bishop of St. Da-
vid's. Giraldus resigned, his nephew was
appointed Archdeacon of st. David's‚ and
Prebend of Martru3 but, on the ‘⁶ petition
and presentation of the nephew, the new Bi·
shop confirmed ιο Master Giraldus the per-
petual and free administration of the reve-
nues of both dignities.” -Ibid, p. 609.
Thus the great contest for the dignity of
Wales ended in a family settlement! It
is a strange pei-version of history to com-
pare such a man to st. Thomas of Canter-

. hury3 but Dr. Lynch is too severe in sup-

posing that the contest for the metropolitan
rights of the see of St. David's, in which
Giraldus engaged, was in itself discreditable.
It was a good cause in bad hands. Giraldus
gives five reasons for his nepotism 3 but his
nephew afterwards deserted him: “ non abs-
que notii infamiae perpetuae innaturalem si-
mul et ingratum.”—Ibid. p. 620.
