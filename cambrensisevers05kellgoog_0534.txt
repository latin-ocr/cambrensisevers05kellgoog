the period when Gaul, Spain, and Britain, were convulsed hy the contest between Albinus
and Sevems, Irish tradition recorda the return (arrival 5²) of Mogh Nuadhat, the Eiberian
patriarch, with a large army, from Spain, by which he laid the foundation 91· the perma-
nent greatness of his family.-09y92·a‚ p. 315. This invasion is, of itself, sufficient to
explain the origin and history of the Eiberians, except the singular position of the
lainam branch. Whether the grant, said to have been made by Cormac Mac Art to the
Eiberians after the battle of Crinna Breagh (p. 479, supra), can explain the point, Ι
know not ς but if Tighearnach’s period of Munster kings (p. 473, 11. ¹·, supro) be ever found
unmutilated, it may clear up the matter. Finally, judging from the name of the tribe,
which appears to be the same as Eburini, Eburones, &c., it would be impossible to guess
whence they came3 for, though it was very common in Celtic Spain, it was also found
among the Belgas of northern (luuh—Histoire dec Gaulois, vol. ii. p. 373 Humboldt,

1 have already directed attention to the mysterious part which the Tuatha Dea play
in Irish tradition. They have left nothing after them but their fame and their reputed
buildings. No genealogist has traeed any lrish family to their race during more than
1000 years, though the genealogies or the Firbolgs, who, it is said, preceded them, are yet
preserved. Tbey disappear almost totally, as an Irish race, the moment the Milesians sub-
due them. Like beings of another world, they haunt the mountains, or other secluded
places, and occupy, in popular Irish story, nearly the same position as the fabled Willis of
the mountains of Hungary in the traditional tales of the Maygars of the plains.

The inevitable inference is, that they were either a very small body of men, superior
to other Irish raees in civilization, or, what is far more probable, that they are either the
Irians or Ithians under another name. The oldest and best authorities confess they know
not whence they came.— Ordnamse sarvey, p. 231. Their name, Dea Danann, and Dagda,
one of the greatest οξ them, beat a suspicions lsssemblahce 'to Deatha and Degad of the
Ithiam—p, 509, supra. Two of the Ithian monarchflalso reigned in Aileach‚ the great
monument of the Dea Danann 3 but coincidences of this kind are quite insufficient to justify
any conclusion, for it is manifest that the traditionary stories of different Irish raees have,
as might naturally be expected, been strangely jumhled. Aine, who was one of the last
of Dea, and bequeathed her name to Cnoc Aine in the'county of Limerick, is said, in
popular story, to have been ravished by Olill Olum, King of Munster, in the fourth century.

one feature distinguishes them from all other colonies. They had a mythology,—all
the gods of Irish pagan story being connected with their race. They had a god of the
sea3 a great queen, ‘¹ Morriogna ;’' a goddess of war, ‘⁴ Badbh ;” and other tutelary
deitiae of the arts and sciences. So many absurdities have been gravely broached on the
Finians, or Irish Phoenicians from Africa (where, by the way, the Poeni never called
themselves Poeni [Feine], but Chenani, as St. Augustino assures us), that it is most desi-
rable to avoid rash conjectures on the existence of a colony in Ireland from the civilized
nations of the ancient world. But the history of the Ionian colony of Marseilles, cor-
rectly compiled by Thie :ry (vol. i. p. 26, vol. ii. p. 111) from the classic authors, bears so
