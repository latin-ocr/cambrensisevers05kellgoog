ditable to themselves was most diligently recorded. Their example
would extenuate Giraldus’s guilt, if the criminal could pleed in his
justification that he only followed in the footsteps of other criminals.
Example is, in such case, no ground for mitigation of punishment.

Hector Boethius deserves the same character. Stanihurst says of
him: ‘⁴ He labored with au his might for the glory of his nation3 but
his vain ambition was prejudicial to his country, to her honor, and to
his own reputation. For to this point have his works now come, that
the learned hardly believe there is one word of truth in them, though
he wished to appear as writing for truth's-sake alone.'’ Thus Hum-
phrey Lhyud stigmatizes him as a most abandoned fellow‚ and quotes
Leland’s epigram:

‘⁸ A list of Hector's lies—his lies in history!
Pray ask it not, dear render, ’tis a mystery3

Count all the waves that o’er the ocean roll,
Or stara that wheel around the glistaening pole.”

As Giraldus followed the example of Boethius, and writers of a similar - ,
stamp‚ always praising his friends, and calumniating his enemies‚ he
has no reason to complain of the following satirical invective:

“ Giraldus proudly boasts his British name,
And lauds in stilted prose his country's fame3
But potu-s, in poisonous streams on Erin's state,
The boarded venom of his rancorous hate.
True dog-..he whines and licks his master’s handu
But rabid and ngm against the stranger stands3
An truth he hides by false and fulsome praise‚
As murky clouds obscure the sun’s bright rays:
The faith of r'ev'rend men, the truthful page,
He slights and desecrates with Vandal rage.
Truth from his treacherous pen indignant ssieS,
And scorns all oontact with his polished lies.
His books—a compound of false praise or blame-
With candid readers can no credit claim.
He wrote for glor-y, but he wrote in vain3
What glory can the raving madman gain?
As hate or spleen dietam, his pen obeys,
And wins calumnioua not historie bays-
The friend of vioe—virtue’s malignam foe!
His works with good men ne'er shall honor know?
