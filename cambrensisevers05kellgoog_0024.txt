The copy of the Alithonologia, and its Supplement, cited in this
work, were transcribed for the Editor, undci the ‹lirection of the
Rev. J. Postlewhite, S. J., Stonyhurst. Stephen WVhite'sApologia,
against GiralduS, which will be very useful on several pointS, was , ·
transcribed from a copy in the Bibliotheque de Bourgogne, Brus· ⁶ .
seIS, and forwarded to the Editor by the Rev. J. Tinnebroek, S. J .,
Louvain. No sheet of this volume has passed through the press
without the revision of J. O'Donovan‚ Esq., in those details on
which his unrivalled knowledge of Irish topography, and familiar
acquaintance with I'rish MSS, could alone secure accuraey3 but
he is not in any way accountable for the editorial speculatione
Mr. Hardimam the guardian of Dr. Lynch's fame, has kindly given,
through George Smith, Esq„ the use of his copy of Canibrensis
Eversum To William Elliot Hudson the obligations of our
· Society are so great, that if this volume is not inscribed to him,
it is solely because the Editor's earnest request could not induce
him to suspend a rule made by the Society‚ that its publicatione

ῃ should have no patron but the Public. It is but justice to say,

that if our edition of Cambrensis Eversus has not shared the fate
of a fragment of it, dedicated-fifty-three years ag0, by T. O'Flana-
gan, to Hem-y Grattan, we may thank the generous and untiring
zeal of Mr. Hudson alone3 for when a. calamity‚ unprecedented in
the annals of the world, hadoeoncentrated on more pressing object-s
the attention of those to whom the Society has a right to look for
support, he was true to the motto of Dr. Lynch, “ Semper fidelis‚”
giving to the Editor encouragement and literary aid, and to the
Society that substantial support which preserved its existence, and
which asks no reward but the co·operation of our Members to
complete the good work.
