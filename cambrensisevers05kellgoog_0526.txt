of Hem-y 11„ the Strongbownians, in the rural districts, had become so Irish in language,
dress, and manners, that the English found it necessary to enact the celebrated Statute of
Kilkenny. In less than 150 years after that Statute, which was chiefly defensive, and
intended for the Pale, all its principal provisions were abandoned by the Parliaments of
the Pale; some of the most influential of the few remaining Anylo-Irish threatened that
they “ would all become Irish ;'' and Cromwell complained. to the Council of Hem-y VIII .‚
that “the English blood was worn out of the land.'' The same law of amalgamation
operated aster the reign of Hem-y vm„ and with &regularity which admits of calcula-
tion, if due allowanee be made for three extensive English colonies in the course of the
'seventeenth century, and other well-known extraordinary obstacles to a fusion of the taces.
How difficult, then, must it not be to attempt to define the various invasione and revolu-
tions of homogeueons Celtic races in Ireland during the 700 years from the foundation of
Eamania to the death of the last pagan king, Dathi. But that the difficulty is insupe-
rable no person can believe, who is acquainted with the system employed by A‘medee
Thierry in fixing the localities of the different Celtic races in Gaul, and by A. Humboldt
in his comparative view of the Spanish and Gaulish Celts. The following pages may,
perhaps, contributa to elicit some of the facts involved in our legendary history:

In a treatise on the pagan cemeteries of Ireland there is a passage which may throw
light on the origin of the Eiremonian family. The writer is not treating expressly of the
regal succession, but os the cemeteries in which the kings were buried ς and, perhaps, for
that very reason he is entitled to greater respect, as sepulchral monuments, associated in
national tradition with certain kings, or races of kings, would be more credible witnesses
than naked genealogies. The treatise is published by Mr. Petrie (Round Temen, p. 96)
from a manuscript of the twelfth century ς but- the original must have been several can-
turies more ancient, coevalsat least, with Tighearnach.

After enumerating the eight principal cemeteries of the Irish‚ “ before the raith‚” the
author proceeds: “ Oenach Cruaehan, in the first place; it was there the mee osz'remon,
i. e. the kings of Tara, were used to bury until the time of Crimthan, the son of Lughaidh
Riabhndearg, viz. Cobthach Coelbreagh, and Labhraidh Loingseach and Eochoid Feidloch,
with his three sons, and Eochoid Airemh, Lughaidh Riabhndearg, the six daughters of
Eochoid Feidleaeh, and Ailill Mac Meda, with his seven brothers.” He then explainswhy
these kings were buried at Cruachan‚ in Roscommon3 and adds, that from Crimthan, son
of Riabhndearg‚ included, down to Loegaire, the Einemonian kings were, with a few excep-
tions, buried at Brugh, on the banks of the Boy ne. This writer manifestly had never heard,
or did not believe, that there were Eisemonian kings before Labhraidh Loingseach, or he
would have told us where they are interred. Itis to be observed also, that the reigns of
this Labhraidh Loingseach and Lughaidh Riabhndearg must have been remarkable epoche
in Irish history. Both are mentioned by Tigheamach3 the former, as the first of thirty La-
genian kings of Ireland (notes, p. 446, suprd); the latter, as the first of thirty kings of
Leath Cuinn (notes, p. 472, εαρτὰ, A. D. 79). Labhraidh, Ι conclude, was therefore the
