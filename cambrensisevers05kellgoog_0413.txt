As to the rapacious eye they cast on the property of the Church,
and the oontmination of their souls, by their sacrilegious appropriation
of her revenues, Gis-aldus himself is our witness. He complains that
the plunder and destruction of church property was a crime of which
all the English soldiers‚ without exception, were guilty, from the very
first day of their arx-ivah so'that, in his own words, “ Beggary is on
this wretched clergy in Ireland3 the cathedral churches mourn, de-
spoiled of their lande, and robbed of those am ple domains vested in them
by the confiding and fervent piety of former ages.” But after he had
stated that “ Meyler was ambitione of fame and glory, and referred
all his actions to thos‘e ends, that whatever extended his fame that he
labored by all means to accomplish, and that he was far more ambitione
to be reputed, than to be in reality virtuous,” he adds, in another
places “ that both he and Raymond would have won for themselves· the
brightest wreath of glcry, if they had renounc'ed their ambition, and,
like dutiful children of the Church of Christ, had not only preserved
intact all her old and undoubted rightS, but had alec, by a 'generous
liberality, offered to her an atonement to Hesven, a portion of their
new and blood-stained acquisitions, as a penance for a conquest polluted
by the eff usion of sp much Christian blood, and the extirpation of a
people².” This was the fatal fount of the many maledictions that fell on
the first invaders of Ireland‚ and especially on Fitzstephen, Raymond,
de Courcy‚ and Meyler‚ who, according to Giraldus himself, left no legi-
timete heir to inherit their property& Why should 1 mention the visi·
tatione from heaven, by which the anger of God manifested itsels against
the perpetrators of those crimeS, and punished them with the most
terrible judgments²i³ Cambrensis himself gives a detailed history of
