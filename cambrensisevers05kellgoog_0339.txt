necessary, as some barbarous marauders in many places vent their Van-
dal fury on every harp which they meet, and break' it in pieces. For
Ir'eland loved the harp, and when it was banished from almost every
other country she clung to it with a fonder effectionr, it was quartered
on her national armsfg its music was her delight. The trunk or prin-
cipal framework of the harp is generally of yew or sallow23 it is broad
below, but tapers to the topr, the interior is hollowed3 the front is
polished with a plane, and perforated with a great number of small
’110100 in a. straight line from t'op to bottom. The holes ere lined with
brass circles to protect them against the friction of the brass stringe.
The back of the trunk is closed with a board. From the top of the
trunk (which is also called the breast or belly), a shaft projecte, curving
inwards, called the vertex or neck, to the extremity of which is affixed
a convex pillar 01· arm, stretching down, and fastened to the lowe'r part
of the trunk. Through the sides of the neck run a number of brass
keys, which are perforated in their left end, and are angular at the
right. To the former the chords are fastened‚ and, by applying to the
right end a key (the handle of which is either wood or horn), the brass
keys are turned, and the chords‚ which are fastened below to pegs in
the breast of the harp, under the line of small holeS‚ are thus tightened
or loosened, as the harper wishes. At both sides of the strings there
are larger holes in the trunk of the harp, to receive and emitpir, and
also to allow the pegs‚ to which the stringe are fastened, to be changed. ·
The end of the curved neck is coated on both sides with brass platee,
which connect it elegantly with the bow-like pillar. The neck and
pillar are ornamented with yaried and exquisite sculpture. In my own

ε Though· the following description is
very elaborate, it is doubtful whether it
would be· clearly intelligible if some of the
old harpe had not been preserved. Some
important points are entirely omitted, such
as the various dimensione of the harp, and
the number of the stringe, &c &c- As the
