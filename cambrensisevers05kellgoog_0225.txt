The Irish chiefS, moreover, levied on the inhabitants os the English
Pale the tribute ,known by the name of the ‘⁴ block rent‘‚”--a tribute
which no parliament disputed before the yearl537, the 28 Henry V111.⁸ ·
But in that same parliament it was ordnined, that homicides committed
within the dominions of Irish princes should bexpunished with a fine
of sorty pounds, half of ’ which went to the King of England, the other
half to the Irish chieftain. At the same time it was ordered, that all
thests of sums below fourteen Pence should be punished with fines of five
marks, of which twenty· six shillings and eight pence went to the Irish
ehieftaim and twenty shillings to his tumst, or appointed successor; the
English themselves· thus expressly recognising the right of the Irish
prince to have his own laws and tributes within his own territoriesh.
The relations between the two races were regulated by formal treaties
of pesce; thus we find the English sometimes coming ιο the aid of Irish
princes¹. “ Balph Ufford‚ the J usticiary of Irelsnd‚ entered Ulster‚ de·-

¹· Davis (pp. 216, 217, ed. 1666) cites,
for these arrangements, not the statut-es,
but the Council Book of Irelimd, 33 Hen-

,mise between English law md soversignty

on the one side, and Brehon law and Irish
independence on the other, when the Iriah
ehiefs submitted to the Lord Deputy. But
Davis, from whom Dr. Lynch takes the
facts, admits that, ‘⁴ though it was a good
beginning, yet it was far from reducing Ire·
land to the perfect obedientie of the Crown
of Enghmdl’ As to the fines intended to
be levied for manslaughter and theft, “no
forfeiture, fine, or revenne (certain or ca-
sual), did acci-ue to the Crown out of these
provinces, namely, Comaught, Ulster, Mun-
ster, and a great part of Leinsterss’
