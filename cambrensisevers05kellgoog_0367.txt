must have been no ordinary tyro, but a most consummate adept in the
by-ways of litigation, who spent not only many years, but his whole
life, in assailing the character of others, and whose incessant appeals to
the public tribunale engraved his name in no fleeting charactere, but
in adamantine incisions on the public records, to immortalize his pug-
nacity.- A palpable proof of this temper is found in the fact, that he
had scarcely time ·to breathe after his unsuccessful controversy with his
foriner antagonist‚ when we find-him at war with Galil-idn Prior of Lan-
thony, whose right to the bishopric of St. David’s he contested before
Innocent 111. But this battle was, like the preceding, unsuccessfuL Not
discouraged, but irritated by his bad success, he makes a similar‘ assault
on Albin, Abbot of Baltinglass. Could anything but an unnatural love
of discord induce a man to plunge into so many unsuccessful contro-
venies? There is good reason to believe that hewas defeated by Albin,
wh0, on Gimldus's refusalss, was nominated by King John to the bishopric
of FernS, a dignity which the King would not confer on the adversary

the Irish Church, and especially the incon-
tinence of some priests, to the evil example
of the foreign clergy who accompanied the
invaders. Giraldus attempted to reply next
day.

Ε After refusing Ferus, he was offered,
he says, Ferns and Leighlin united—Bet.
Ges. c. xiii. In his old age he boasted
that he was offered three Irish bishoprics
and one archbishopric‚ two Welsh bishop-
ries, the see of Lincoln, a Cardinal's hat.

and even his own St. David's, if he would
surrender its metropolitan rights—Aufida
sacra, vol. ii. pp. 614, 615. “ Dudum‚” he
says, “inter alios cornutus incedere potui.”
A court fool often amused the courtiers
at his expense by asking him: “Master
Giraldus, will you accept the see of Ferns ?
-Nolo. Of Ossory ⁴?4N0lo. Of 'Leigh-
lin ?—Nolo. The Arcbbishopric of Cashel?
—Nolo.'’ But, in the end, he added, “ The
see of St. David’s?”—-‚and immediately
shouted out, anlid roars of general laughter,

“ Volo-'’-Iln‘d But Giraldus himself is
the only authority for those proffered ho-
nors. His reasons for declining them are
contradictory. He was too young, he says,
when some were offered (though he was
only thirty when he would accept St. Da-
vid‘s); others “were poor sees, and inter
barbaros ‚·” (St. David's was paupercula);
he would not accept the Irish sese, because
he knew the Irish would never voluntarily
elect a foreigner3 (he had endeavoured to
foroe a Norman bishop on his own country-
men, the Welsh, who were equally opposed
to foreigners >3 finally, electione were in
those days mere court inti-ignes, without

¹any ecclesiasticaldiberty, and he could not

sanction them by his acceptance3 (though
he invariably flattered all living kings, and
maligned them when dead): and if he, a
Welshman, could obtain two Welsh mitres,

why did he say he was excluded from St. · ,

David‘s because he was a Welshman ¹?—
