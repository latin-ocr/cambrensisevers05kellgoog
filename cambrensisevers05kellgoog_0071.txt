and their family estates, they refused to grant to man'y of them even
the miserable farms¹ that had been promised, and compelled them, igno-
minioualy, to beg their bread from door to door. A vast number of my
countrymen have been banished far from their native soil, to no certain
settlement, but to an inheritance of misery. They were not allowed
even to breathe their «native air, and could only murmur at their depar-
ture the indignant complaint: ’

“ For-ced from our‘ pleasing flelds and native home.
Did we for these barbariam plant and sow? ”

The Pagan Romans themselves were much more merciful to the
vanquished, depriving them of only a seventh of their land, to be occu·
’ pied by settlers; and though, in progress of time, the confiscation of
some rose to a fourth, a third, and, at last, to a half of the conquered ter-

even he complained that„ in the former plantation of Ireland, the old
established maxims of all well-constituted states had been shamefully
neglectedu. For, whenever they planted colonies‚ certain settlements
