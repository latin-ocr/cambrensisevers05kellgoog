tion of ,the Irish language. 1 have been
informed, moreover, by ΜΓ. O'Donovan, a
most competent Judge in thie matter, that
y. is frequently usedby ancient Irish ‘writers
for cn or ρο, aud ὑ for b [υ]. From auch
uncertainty regardiug lhe number of Irish
lettere, and the undeniable fect, that in
none of the ancient Pagan duns or cemete-

ries have any inscriptions or traces of such,

· in any chal-actem, Greek or Latin, been as

yet discovered, it is now inserted by the
best Irish scholare, that the Irish first be-
came acquainted with letters in the aeeond
οι· third century of the Christian* era, pro·
bably through Christian missiouaries, who
adopted from the Lat-in as many of the
Roman letters as they required to expreoe
the simple sounds of the lrish language.
This opinion, if it needed other arguments,
could be established indirectly by the au·
thority of Tighernach, the most trustwor-

thy of all our annalista for, while his notioes ¹

os Irish history, down to the third century,
are confined to a meagre list of kings, and
a few events which tradition could easily
preserve, he descende to detailsin thereign
offici-mac, that ie, the period. which, in tra-
dition, has bem associated with the dann-
ings of the Christian saith in Ireland. For
the Phoenician letters in boland, the render
may consult pege 469, note θ, page 475,
note ⁸, supra. The Phoenicians had dis-
appeared for centurion, even the Carthagi·
niens had bgen defeated in the first Punic

war, probably before the foundation of Ea-
mania. But with regard to O’Flaherty’s
opinion, though it is at present as baselese
as O’Oonor’s, yet is any ‹lii-eet evidence,
monumental or written, even of a dubious
character, should ever be discovered of the
use of letters in Ireland, previous to the
Christianera, many collateral proofs could
be urged to sustain it. The Greeks of
Marseiues were an Ionian colony ; the Ionian
letters vvere the first yenerally received in
the west: “ Gentium consensus tacitus pri-
mus omnium conspiravit ut Ionum literis
uterentur ” (Pliny, lib. vii. c. 58), eigh-
tcen, according to Aristode, vves the num-
ber of the most ancient Greek letters; the
Ionian colony of Marseilles carried on an
extensive trade with th‘e interior of Gaul,
and especially with its western porte, then
the great depots of British tin (Tmen-ry,
Histoire aa Gauzois, vol. ii. p. 140), and,
finally, the legend of St. Cadroe, written in
the eleventh century (Colyan, Acta Sanct.
p. 494), brings a colony of Greeks to Ire-
land, in very remote times, from Asia Minor,
the home of the Ioni'ans. But how vain
conjectures are on the origin, number, and
powers of letters, every one knows who has
ever taken the, trouble of inspecting learned
treatises on the subject3 and the difficulty
here would be considerably increased by
Pliny’s remark, “ the Ionian letters are the
same which the Romans now use.''
