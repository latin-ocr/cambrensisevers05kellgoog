difficultie8.” At length, being attacked by the De Lacies‚ he was de-
spoiled of all his property and banished.. “ Thence returning to Ulster
with one hundred ship5, to the port of 'Strangford, he endeavoured to
besiege Rath, butWalter de Lacy‚ ‘coming up with an army, beat him
away. From that day Courcy never recovered his land.”

But Giraldus’s friend3‚ and those heroes whom he has so highly ex-
tolled‚ were not so remarkable for their noble deeds as for their impiety
and robbery, plundering, in violation of all lawe, every person they
met, and pouncing with sacrilegious fury on the property of the Church.
‘⁴ For they invaded not Leinster alone‘²‚ but other kingdoms, to which
neither the Earl nor his wife had the slightest claim.” Fitzstephen
entered ·the kingdom of Ireland without the King’s consent, and gave
others an opportunity osmaligning him, “ so that he incurred the King’e

, displeasure, andawas cast into prison, where lie was long detained in

chains, 'As to the occupation of Leinster, neither Fitzstephen nor the
Earl'aean be called a robber, because both were connected with Der· .
mod, the former as a liegeman, the latter as a son-in-law3 and by his
title both justly held their acquisitions. But, with regard to Water-
ford and Desmond, and also the parts of Meath unjustifiably seized by
the Earl, 1 do not undertake to defend him.” Now, as Fitzstephen
co-operated with the Earl' in his predatory incursione into Munster, Ι
say if the Ea'rl was a robber, Fitzstephen was one also· For if a man
associate and eat with a band of robbers, is there any injustice in calling
= him a robber? and is it not most unjust in Giraldus‚ a most flagrant
violation of equity, in favor of his uncle, not to ma'ke both bear the dis-
grace of a crime in which both are accomplices' P Especially when N ew·—
bury appears to confirm my view: “ The English crept into Irelan‘d
as mercenary soldierS, and then, sending for auxiliaries‚ swelled their
ranks with men of broken fortunes and thirsting for money. At length*
they invited over from England Earl Richard to command them, a great
and powerful nobleman, but who, in his magnanimity, was liberal be-
yond his means, and had squandered his immense revenues and wasted
- his patrimony, and was completely at the mercy of his creditorsw.”
