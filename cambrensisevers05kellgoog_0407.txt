engagement Meyler and Robert Barry bore away the palm of valor from
all their compeer8.” His other uncle, Maurice Fitzgerald0, is thus de-
scribed: “ Α man distinguished for fidelity and valor, of feminine mo-
desty, but in truth of word and soul inferior to none.”
‘⁴ A breve, prudent, and modest man, who did not leave his like after' ·

valor. His two sons, Alexander and Gerald (the latter of whom, though
of small stature, was distinguished for prudence and probity), won
wreaths of military glory on the plains of Leinster.” Not content with
the lavish encomiums he passed on them as a body, he singles out indi-
viduale, and makes each of them a hero.. “ These strained and elaborate
panegyrics on his cousins could hardly be justified by their actions3
their worth cannot be of that exalt-ed order which his ingenious coloring
represents3 he pictures them not only as rivalling the martial glory of
Alexander, Pompey‚ Annibal, Caesar, and other sons of Μαι-3, but as far
transcending them in famev.

But it is worth noticing, that while he thus praises the Welshq in a
most extravagant manner, who were his countrymen and kindred, he
was rather niggard of his praise to their English adsociatesr in the inva-
sion. The following, for instance, is his character of De Courcy: ‘⁸ He

quest was eommenced, he says, and by
them only could it be completed, when the

to the bogs and mountains.

¹* Giraldus does not appear prejudiced

against De courcy, nor against the Eng-
lish, so much as against the Nonnans, who

’ were “the highest in credit and estima-

tion.” “They were fine in apparel, deli·
cate in diet, and could not digest their
meat without wine at each meal. They
would not serve in the marchas, or any re-
mote place, but they would be where they
had plen ty3 they could talk and brug, swear
and stare, and, standing in their own repu-
tation, disdain all others. The noble ser-
vitors, who had first adventured and made
conquests, were held in contempt and sus-
picion, while the new comers only were
called to counsel, and they only credited
and honored.”--Hib. Expuq. lib. ii. c. 34.
