enemies‚ our countrymen‚ who were eeattered homeless end vegabonds
in many foreign countries,-were recelled by γους not into e civil society
from mountain8‚ woods‚ end deserte, whence the mester· end creatore
of civilized life collected the first hordea of sevege men, but to the
bosom of their own most delightful and beloved country, from their
protracted end eheerless exile. Truly, *ᾗ thou hest 'brought beck ou'r

popular odium, nor recelled with greater joy then Cicero‚” so with us3

and no one 'experieneed e hei-der sete or bore it with greater fortitude
than youh. Like Dido of old‚‘ ‘by your sad experienee you have been
taught to suecour the distressed.” When Ι turn over before my mind’s
eye the long peges of history, Ι een find no apter parallel of the eruelty
of our enemies to my countrymen than those thi'rty tyrents who were

forced on the people of Athens by the LaeedemonienS. Ae the tyrents ”

homes those who had escaped the horrore of wer, confisceting their pro-

allied States end eities not to give refuge to the exibe, so these took
cere thet the King‚ end his bend of faithful follower8‚ should be ex-
eluded from Frenee. The remnant of the Atheniens who ,remained et
home were disermed, and driven from the city to live among their ruined ¹
fortifications: my countrymen were disarmed' end penned up in the
narrow limite of Connaught. But es Thresibulus brought back his
