the terrors of the scaffold could not exorcise Giraldus's propensity, the
oracles of God himself ought to have reclaimed him. They announce
that ‘⁶ the soul which turneth away to soothsayers or magicians shall
die the death ;” and* ‘⁶ neither let there be found among you any one that

itself could not secure impunity for Saul or Ochozias; the former con·-
sulted the Pythoness and was slain3 the latter turned to Beelzebub, and
died. Itis truly astonishing how a man, who was a respectable theolo-
gian in his day, could have forgotten those things,

But “ the end of one evil is a step to another.” Once entangled in
the mazes of divination‚ GiralduS, by a natural transition, lost his head
in the interpretation of dreams. To such a degree of infatuation was
he carried that he often spun out interminable dissertatione in relating
and diffusely commenting on dreamS, and twisting and accommodating
them to imaginary interpretations. ‘⁶ Visi,ons'’ was the respectable de·-
nomination under which he introduced the profane dreams. of others
and his own to the public⁰; he was not shocked at the profanation of
applying a sacred word ‘to a profane thing3 as if all the revel-ies which
arose from bodily indisposition‚ or the murk y suggestions of hell, should
have all descendcd straight down from heaven. In his dissertation on
dreams‚ he inclines strongly to the opinion of those who maintain their
truth. “ It is only the presumption of man‚'' he affirms‚ f‘that pre·
vents them from being terrified by, dreams.'’ This he said in reproving
his brother Walter for having engaged in a battle contrary to a warn-
ing received in a dream. He cites, moreover‚ a great number of dreamS,
which had been fulfilled‚ and gives only one instance of a false dream,
wishing by 811 these examples to establish a belief in dreamS‚ and weaken
the opposite opinion, which he merely states, without any argument in
its defence. “ Dreams,” he sayS, ‘⁴ like· rumora, are things of such a.
nature that* they are to be at times believed and disbelieved.'’

This opinion, he ought to have know‘n, was contrary to the order
