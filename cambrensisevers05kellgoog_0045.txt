to give no indulgence to others. but, heedless ostrum, to turn the 'odium
of event, according to their prejudices or interests.'’ All the Senators
in that Parliament are so many Syllae. During his dictatorship all per-
sons were exposed to confiscation‚ exile, and death: we are now fearfully
threatened with the loss of our properties. The emissaries whom they
have despatched to lreland have long since been sounding in our ears,
⁸⁶ that we were conquered by their arms, and must resign the iuberi-
tancoe of our fathers, and surrender them to themselves? ' The lawe

But they apply the laws of a just war to the robberies by which they
have so long and so grievously harassed us. Rebellion against a King,
treachery to allice, are not wars but robberies. They ground their
right on what they call the happy issue of the war, their victories‚ and

the innocent'are often defeated by the guilty, with greater loss to the
conquerors than the conquered‚ because nothing is more fatal than the
felicity 'of ‘the evil-doer. Their repeated assertions', that God has ap-

imitation of the Arian Emperor Constantine, who was constantly boast-
