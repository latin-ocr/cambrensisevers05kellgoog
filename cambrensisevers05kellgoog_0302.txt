⁸ In another place, the innovatione in
Irish ecclesiastical discipline, introduced by
the English, will be pointed out. The King
of England assumed the same power over
the Irish which he enjoyed in the English
Church. He granted Conqe d’Elv’re, and
restored temporalities, and exercised many
similar prerogatives, which formed no part
of the common Church law of Ireland be-
fore the invasion. When this new disci·
pline was firmly established, the Church

became the stronghold not merely of the ·

English, but of the royal power-3 because in
all the granta, even of palatine liberties, to
the great English barons, the King reserved
to himself the right of appointIng sheriffs
to the Crocca, or church lands, in those
Palatinatea—-Davis‚ p. 114. But no Eng-
lish king, before James 1., nominated to the
see of Raphoe. Elizabeth nominated Myler
M‘Grath (appointed Catholic Bishop oi*
Down by the Pope) to the see of Clogher,
Sept. 18, 157ος but he was removed in
February following to the united sees of
Cashel and Emly. Edward 11. granted a
Couye d'Elire for an election to the see of
Derry, in the thirteenth year of his reign

(Rot. Pac), while Del-ry was under the
power of the Red Earl, who erected the new
Castle of Inishowen in 1305. The asser·
tion of Dav1s, with regard to the sees of
Der-ry and Glogher, ia, therefore, not strictly
correct. The Irish prelatas, in catholic
times, often resisted the unjust encroach-
ments of the Crown on the liberties of the
Church. Nicholas Mac Maelisa, Archbi-
shop of Armagh, founded an association for
that object. — See note ¹¹, p. 224, supra.
This resistance to the Crown Dr. Mant calls
rebellion.

¹¹ Sir John Davis himself, as Attorney-
General in Ireland, bore a distinguished
part in completing the conquest. The fol-
lowing soene in the old abbey of Devenish,
Lough Erue, where the first Fermanagh
assizes were held in 1607, confronts the
last of the Brehons with the English judge.

roll remaining in the hands of one O’Bris-
lon, a chronicler and principal brehon of
that country, whereupon O’Brislon was sent
