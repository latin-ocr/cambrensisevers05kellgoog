feating the Ultonians on twenty-five fields, the Legenians as often, the A. D.
Conscinns as osten, and the men of Munster not ‘less than thirty-five -q
times⁸3 so that he almost extirpated the rece of the Athachtuatha in all
parts of Irelnnd'. Having received hosta-,ges for the fidelity of those

whom the sword had spared, he appointed kings for the four provinces:
Fergus, in Ulster3 Eogan‚ son of Olill, in North end West Munster3
Eochoidh, son of Deire, in South and Esst Munster3 Eochoidh, son of
Eochoidh Dumplene‚ in Leinster3 and Condrsch‚ son of Derg, in Con-
naught¹. He also established the Convention of Tara, which was
attended by an the provincial kings, and other great Irish nobles]
who swore by the great pagan oeth¹,-the sun, the moon, the stam,
and. an the elements‚-that they never would revolt from his sceptre,
but would bear true homage to him and his descendants for ever.
This oath was like that which their ancestors pledged to Hugsine the
Great. Moreover‚ they promised that they would assist him and his,
against all enemies for evei-². 'l'uathal took from each of the five pro·-
vinces of Ireland a considerable territory, which he added to Meath,
thus extending its name and limits⁸ far beyond the original small district

of Usneachb. The new province wass decreed to be for ever the appen-

ehaidh Feidhlench instituted, cr rather revi-
ved the Pentarchy3 but wc are not to sup-
pose that ench penta-ch had the supreme
dominion of his province by a. tenure which
made his government independent of a sn-

monarchy which has slwsys existed in this

nevertheless, that tit-ie appears down to the
reign of Tuathal. The formation of Meath
appearswbe the firststcptowardsthe
establishment os a centn-el power. Then,
for the first time, we find the Κίος of Ire·-
land coming into collision with the five
provinces, and gradually establishing that
frail species of supremacy subsequently en·-
joyed by the Irish Ardrigh οι· Monarch-

still nearly preserved in those of the diocese.
Tuathal, it is said, established solemn ns-
semblics, to be held annuslly on the last
day of October, at Tlachtga, the Merno-
nian portion of Menth5 on the first of May,
at Uisneach, in the Connaught portiom and
at Tsiltin, in the Ulstet portion, about the
first of August. At Tura, in the Leinster
portion, the Fcis was assembled ttiennially.
Each of the provincial kings had s right to
some tribute on occasion of the assembly
held in what was once part of his province.

and it so happens that some of the most
famous Druids were of the Irisn tribe.—
