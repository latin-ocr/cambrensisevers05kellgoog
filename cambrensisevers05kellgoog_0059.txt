loyalty to a- prinee'who was then after renounoin‘g the dogmas of the
ancient coeed, very severe statutes were not eneoted agaimt them, the
penul enactments of this present Parliament cannot now be justified
by any plea ef necessity or expediency, when the Catholies have given
repeated and unequivocal proofs of their loyalty‚ and the change of the
religion of the State has been consolidated by time.

Queen Elizabeth herself had not such a horror of the Catholio saith,
as not to give several proofs of her regal-d for it. “ She had the greatest
esteem for Lord Visoount Montague, and visited him, though he was
a most staunoh Roman Catholic. For she knew that he had imbibed
that oreed from early education, and conscientium convictiom and not
from faotious motives, like too many others.” King James also said,
“ that he loved a Papist who was otherwise a good man and well edu·
cated, andwho had never‘professed any other faith.” So great was the
confidenee reposed in the Catholios by your father, King Chai-les, that
with his eonsent they were intrusted· with the government of towns .
and provinces3 and to you they have evinoed loyalty so devoted, that
the last extremes of human misery could not shake it, though 'Phalaris
himself should dietate treason and perjury under the torture of his
bull. The highest eulogy our oountry desires, is, that Ireland has been
always loyal to her King.{

The disloyalty of the Catholios is not the real cause(¹ of the attempts
of the Commons to insite your hatred against us· but thqr fear that
they themselves may not be allowed to retain—as the servioe-money
of their sedition, the salary of their rebellion‚ the wages of their murder
and robbery, and the reward of their impiety--those estates inherited
by Catholios from ancestors who held them as the emblema of their
nobility‚ the support of their dignity, the tribute to their worth, and
the reward of their virtues “ By depriving us of all means of supporting
life, and, therefore, of life· itself ‚—by hewing out a path to wealth for
themselves, over our slaughtered bodies ‚--they renew the orim'e of ‹Ieza-
bel, who murdered N aboth to get his vineyard· for her husband Ahab3

or of Herod, who polluted himself with that atrocious massaore of the
Innocents, lest he might be deprived of his orown. x ¹

bal English interest gives· no quarter to the diets, after an age or two, be likewise ds-
children of the English, may not the pos— voured.’‘—Sale‚ δια, p. 106.
