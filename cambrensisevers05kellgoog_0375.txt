of Scripture, not to consult soothsayers nor observe dream& And
Ecclesiasticus adds:·“ Dreams lift up fools; for dreams have deceived
many, and they have failed that put their trust in them3 the man that
giveth heed to lying visions is like to him that catcheth at a shadow, and
followeth after the wind.” GiralduS, therefore, has laboured in vain,
when he endeavoured to support the authority of dreams. The fol-
lowing lucid and pithy sentence of St. Gregory disclusa, summarily,
the source whence'dreams proceed: ‘⁶ The devil is sometimes in the
habit of foretelling many true events in dreams, that, in the end, he
may succeed by ensnaring a soul in one falsehood.'’ But if Giraldus
be impregnable by prose, perhaps he may be sostened by the poetry of
another Gregory:

‘⁶ Give to deluding dreams no credence vain,
Unmoved by omens, or of joy or pain3
Preserve thy peace, by reason’s calm control,
From wiles Satanic planned to snare thy soul.’'

Even Seneca himself, though never enlightened by the true saith,
knew, by the aid of reason itself‚ that ‘⁶ a dream is the worst prophet of
the suture’? For the occupations which engage us during the day pre-
sent themselves to our fancy during sleep‚ according to Claudian:

· “ The cares that vex by day the human bremt,
Disturb at night the sleeper’s balmy rest.
The wearied sportsman locked in slumber lies,
But woods and coverts to his vision rise.
Judges dream law, and charioteers a goal,

Where airy cars with speed impetuous roll:
Lovers haunt shades; merchants exchange their wares3

And waking misere mourn their dreaming cares.
Delii-Icus dreams to thirsting patients bring
The welcome beverage from some fancied spring?

No doubt Gir‘aldus persuaded himself that ambassadors from above
waited on him, with full information regarding all things present and
future. He imagined that, in the eye of God, he was as a Jacob, or J oseph
or Solomon, in the Old Testament, or as a «Ioseph in the N ew3 to whom
God graciously revealed himself, and unveiled the secrete of futurity·
Such favors God has often conceded to mortified and saintly men, but

has He ever paid such visits to mortalswrapped in deep sleep‚ and
