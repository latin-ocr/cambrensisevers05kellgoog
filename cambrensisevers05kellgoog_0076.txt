⁸ Immediately after the Roetoration the

' Irish were recavet-ing their properties by

common law, proving descent and title,

but the Courts were closed by the Lords‘

Justices on an Address of the Irish Parlia-
ment.—- Car-te, p. 222. “ It is now more
than two years since the Act (the Black
Bm, 25th of July‚ 1665) went over to Ine-
land, and the siey-four nominees who were
to be restored (as they verily believed) to
their chief hquses and 2000 acras of land,
have not yet got a cottage, or 0110 acre of
ground.''—Settlement, 810. &c., p. 93.

⁸ Under the Commonwealth, catholice
were prohibited, under penalty of death by
martial law, to inhabit or be inany gan-ison,
port, or town, even in Connaught or Clare.
-Scobell, p. 258. Their exclusion was con-
firmed by an address of both houses of Par-

' liament to the Lords J ustiees in 1 661 ( Carte,

psas ), and inserted in the Act of S'ettlement.
Dublin andDrog'heda were excepted, their
‘⁴ innocent ’' catholic inhabitants, who had

been expelled by Cromwell, being allowed ,

ιο return to their homes. But the Catho-
lics of other towns, whether innocent or
not, were expelled, receiving, if innocent, a
promise of compensation in some property
near the town. Galway alone received the
King’s letters patent for the restoration of
its old inhabitant-s, and to it, no doubt,
Dr. Lynch alludes. For the obstruction of
the King’s intention see Hardiman's ‘⁴ His-
tory of Galway,'’ pp. 1¹41, 144, and ‘⁶ Irish

Mintrelsy,” vol. ii. p. 155. The following is
the ,mode of filling the corporations of Mun—
ster observed by Orrery, Lord President
of that province: “ When your Gracc was
pleased to honour me with the trust of
naming those in the corporations of this
province, 1 did (I take God to witness) en-
deavour, to my best, to discharge that
duty. I resolved they should consist only
of conformable Protestants3 and the way I
took was, to order the present magistrates
to return to me a list of 011011 as were con-
formable, and were fittest to be inserted in
the charters. Then 1 made it my rule that,
before Ι did certify to your Graes who were
fit to be inserted, ιο inquire of the Bishop
there, if not of the Dean, whether those
whom I knew not myself to be conformable,
and were by the magistrates represented as
conformable, were so? Nayd did send for
the magistrates thither, and examine the
lists they brought one by one.'’ Sept. 1 7, 24,
1667. Charleville, which was his own crea·
tion, admitted “ neither Presbyter, Papist,
nor Independent, but all good old Protes-
tants.'’ Yet a few Catholics were in all
the corporations of the south. In 1661
he admitted eight into Waterford on, the
petition of Sir John Stephane. Others were

also lieensed in Lixnerick3 but, on the least -

rumour of disturbance‚ the lice-nse was with-
drawn. Thus, in 1663, “ he purged Water-
ford of Papists, and disarmed au‘Papists of
that city and Limerick in 1666,” 011 the ru-
