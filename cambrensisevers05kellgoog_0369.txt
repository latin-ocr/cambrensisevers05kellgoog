of his tutor, if Albin had not justice on his sideh. Gir-aldus, by a just
judgments never obtained the see which had been the grand object os
his toilsi. The Apostle tells us that a bishop must not be ‘⁶ quarrel-
some ;” and the Evangelist teaches‚ ‘⁶ That if a man will contend with
thee in judgmena and take away thy coat, let go thy cloak also unto
him.” W’as Giraldus a tyro in theology Y—or, if he were a learned
divine, could he be ignorant of these simple truths?

But divinationi was a far more agrecable study for Giraldus‚ than
attention to the lectures of divinas& Such an ascendancy had Mcrlin
acquired over his mind, that he entitled his work on ‘⁶ The conquest ·
of Ireland ” a ‘⁶ Prophetic History‚'' from the propheciae of Merlin, the
Caledoniam, and of Ambrosius, “ which hc introduced into that history
in their proper places, according to the nature of the events¹.” Giral·
dus, in the same place, indulges in a lavish panegyric on the merite of
his favorite. “Before my time,” he says, ‘⁴ Merlin the Caledonian had
not put away his barbarous British dress, but slumbered in obscurity
almost -unknown to the world. It appeared a fair field for my industry
to employ the most patient investigation to draw him from his old and
obscure retreats, and present him to the public in freshened beauty‚ and
transfer him from the darkness of oblivion to the light of day. For
it was neither unbecoming nor incongruens· that a work which imparted
authority, and a prophetie character, and even its prophetie title to
my history, should be given to the world aa a sort of continuation to
that history.” In another place he writes that he completed his
Topography in three years, and dedicated it to Henry 11.; but the
‘⁶ Prophetic History ’² he complcted in tum, and dedicated to John,
whence it is evident that the ‘⁶ Prophetic History„ was a title moi-e in

. accordance with Giraldus’s taste than ‘⁶ The Conquest of Ireland.” He

wished, in fact, to raise· the character and confirm the authority of his
