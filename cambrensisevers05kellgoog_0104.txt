Our life is, =therefore, s daily warfare and a living martyrdom on this earth, where we
have to enconnter so many· leopaids. We never venture to approach any of the house·
of the Catholics: we live generally in the mountains, forests, and inaccessible begs, where
the Cromwellisn trooper, at least, cannot resch us.'1hither crowds of the poor Caffiolics
flock to us, whom we refresh by the Word of God and the consolation of the Sacramenta.
here, in those wild and mountain mets, we preach to them constancy ln faith, and the
my stery of the cross of our Lord: here we find true worshippers of God, and chmpions
of Christ. In spite of all the precautions·used to exercise our evangelical ministry in
secret, the Cromwellians often discover it 3 and then the wild beast was never hunted with
more fury, nor tracked with more pertinacity, through mountains, woods and begs, than
the priest: at present, it is a common saying among the misbelievers, ⁴ I em going to
hunt the priestsss'

The writer then proceeds to describe “a hunt* after John carolem a Jesuit· , the
labors of Christopher Neterville, a Jesuit, who lay hidden during a whole year in his
family tomb3 and also of J ames Forde, of whom he says:

‘¹ On a spot of firm ground, in the middle of an immense hog, he constructed for him·-
¹ self a little hut, whither -the boys and youths of the neighbourhood came, and still come,
to be instructed in the rudiments of learning, and of virtue and saith: would that ali
could adopt the conduct of these boys as theirsmodel and example 3 like their master, they
subject themselves to constant sasting and=mortification 3 they go from house to house, and
teach their parents and neighbours at home what they have learned in the bogs.” . ”. . . .

“As we cannot always celebrate mass in those caverns and wild retreats, we· carry
with' us the consecrated hosts* m sufficient number for the spiritual comfort of ourselveas
and of the sick to whom we may be called.. ’

“Το crown our other miserieS, the plague is raging in an quarter's· , but the more -
frightful its ravages, the more prompt and‘zealous is the vigilance of the missionarIes. We
lately ordered prayers to be offered up in all the provinces to appense the anger of heaven,
and every Catholic in the whole kingdom fasted three days on bread and water, -even the
children, babes of three years old, fasted as well as the others; and all not disqualified
hy vears received with great devotion the sacraments of the⁴ Eucharist and Penancest’ . . . .

Τίιο author next describes the sufferings and death of some nuns, Franciscans, Domi7
nicans, and AugustinianS. Of the transplantation to Connaught he says·

“Wound follows wound, that nothing should be wanting to fill up the cup of our suf-
feringS. The few Catholic families that r‘emained were lately deprived, by Cromwell, of
all their immoveable property, and are all compelled to abendon their native estates, and
retire into the province of Oonnaught. Your Reverence is aware that that province is one
scene of desolation, and has been reduced to a desert by the ravages of war. 'rbere is
scarcely a single houoe standing to give shelter to the Catholics: there remain but two
towns, Galway and Loughrea, both of which have been delivered up to the English Ana-
baptists. Into that desert all our Catholics are huddled together, to pei-ish there, or erect ¹
for themselves new houses of woe3 yet, though their only property now are the cattle on
their pastures, they are compelled to pay taxes, and to support all the neighbouring Pro-
testant garrisons to the number of seventy. The design, obviously,‚is to extirpate gra-
