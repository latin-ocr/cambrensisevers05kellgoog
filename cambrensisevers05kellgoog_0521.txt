day in possession of their descendants, who still 818 known by the cha- A. D.
racteristic name of Scoti5.” For this reason Niall is styled by O’Dugan, ‘—
King of Ireland and Alba.

Dathi, nephew to Niall by his brother Fiachm, was the last Pagan⁸ 405
King of Ireland‚ and reigned twenty-three year-³3⁸. His proper name was
Fearadhach3 but he was surnar‘ned Dathi‚ from the rapidity with which
he used to put on his armor: “ Daitheadh‚” in the Irish language, sig·
nifying swiftnesa He pillaged Gaul, and carried his arms even 10 1118
Alpsb, where 118 was suddenly struck dead by a thunderbolt from heaven,
thus expiating 1118 sacrilegious cruelty to Parmenius0, a 111811 highly dis-
tinguished for sanctity‚ A. D. 428, A. M. 5627.

It 18 by no means improbable, that Gaul was scourged during this
and the preceding reign by predatory invaders ‘from Irelandg for St.

J emme, who died A. D. 420, writes, ‘⁶ that, when 8 very young man, he
saw in Gaul the Scots (or, as they 818 called in unpublished manuscripts
the Attacotsd)‚ a British tribe, devour human fiesh3 and that whenever
they fell in with 8 drove of swine, or flocks and herds, in the foreste, ¹
they cut off the women’s breasts and the shepherds’ haunches, and feasted
sumptuously 011 them⁶.” It is probable that there must have been large

 

fore Dathi’s death.

¹¹ supposed to be 1118 same as the Athseh-
tuatha or plebian Irish, subjugated by the
Scoti- Like the barbariam, the Attacots
were taken into 1118 imperial service—Pro-
leqom. pars ii. p. cvi. Dr. O'Gonor proves
clearly that the Roman writers mention
Soots and Attacots as distinct tribes. He
also labours to prove that the latter were
an Irish tribe, and not found either inGaul
or Britain. — Ibid. p. lxxvii. Attacots,
Scots, Picts, and 8181Ξο118, are mentioned as
the assailants of the Roman empire in Bri-
tain and Gaul, and the inroads of the three
former into Britain, recorded by Ammia-
nus, agree with the dates fixed in Irish an-
nalista—Ibid. p. cviii.

⁸ Dr. O’Oonor answers this charge by
saying that, as St. J erome was very young
when he thought he saw the Attacots eat-

ing human flesh, it was probably a nursery
tale 10 deter truant schoolboys from wan··‘
dei-ing into the woods or lonely places:
‘⁴ Nec facile quemquam induci posse ut po-¹
tius pastoris nates manducarent, praesente
adolescentulo Hieronymo, quam Hierony-
mnm ipsum.”—Prole90m. pars i. p. lxxv.
But 88 it must be confessed that Diodorus,
Strabo, and Mela, had made the same

charge against the Attacots before st. J e-
rome, we defer 8 fuller examination ogihis

point to those chapters in which Drss‘iynch

discusses the foreign testimonies regarding

Ireland. Tacitus hnew hardly any differ-
1108 between 1118 habits (“ ingenia cultus-

and penpie of N ew Zealand exhibit more
nearly thanany other those of Britain when
the Romans {metes it.”-v01. i. μ 68, ed. 6.
