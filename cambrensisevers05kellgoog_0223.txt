that beyond those counties English laws were not in force, and thet
Irish laws reigned supreme and without a ri‘val²; and even in consi-
derable districts of these four counties‚ namely‚ half of Dublin sud
Meeth, and one-third of Louth end Kildare⁸, Irish laws were pre-
ν dominant. Such were the confined limits from which Parlisments
were summonedb3 beyond them the king’s writ was powerless⁰; so that
the English never had full possession of even one-third part of Irelandd.
“King John, it is true, in the year already mentioned, divided all
the territories of his Irish lordship into twelve enunties in Leinster
and Munster, namely, Dublin„ Kildare, Meath, Uriel, Carlow, Kil-
kenny, Wexford, waterford, Cork, Limeriek, Kerry, Tippera-ry. In
these only were the English laws published and put in execution, and
in these only did the itinerant judges make their circuits and visitation
of justice, and not in the countries possessed by the Irish, which conm
tained two-‚third parts of the kingdom at least3 'even the four last-
named countieS, after s short time, embraced Irish law0, which, being
thus excluded only from that little corner, the English Pale, ruled
supreme over every other part of Ireland.”

preserve the four half-shires, the last shred

of English power: “ The Lord Deputy,”
he suggests, ‘⁶ should be employed eight days

¹· This was ‚the esse during part of the fif-
teenth century only. In the 14 Hem-5 VIL,
Sir Ed. Poyning annulled the Parlisment
lately held at Droghedn, on the ground that
the writs had been issued only to the Pale.
Thenceforward he ordered all the shires to
be summoned3 but ‘⁴ his lsws were like
good Iessons set for a lute that'is broken
and out of tune.”--Dam‘s‚ Hister. Dm„

‘- Even so late as 1536, the Lord Deputy
complained that the King’s J astices could
not resort to the shires beyond the Bari-ow.

‘¹ This assertionis made on the authority
of Sir John Davis (p. 100) ς but the Eng-

counties were formed by King J ohn.- Stat.
of Kilkenny, p 102. From most of them,
English law was banished, not by the native
Irish, but the degenerare English, “who
became more mortal enemies to the English
name and nation than the mere Irish.’'--÷
