record the deposition of Henry O’Neill, in 1346, the O’Moore had bui-ned the cas-

though they state, A. D. 1344, that Ufford
escaped by the aid of the men of Oriel into
Ulster from Mac Cat-tan, who took all his
baggage, gold, and suver, and some of his
soldiers, in the pass of Emerdullam. This
defeat of the King’s 'representavive by a
Manem-tan was a strange preliminary to
the deposition of an O'Neill, the great Lord
of the North. ³ The Four Masters do not
record Ufford's expedition. In 1345 they

ἢ record an unsuccessi'ul expedition of Hugh

O'Neill against the Clannaboy, and, in 1346,
the slaughter of 300 English by Mac Ma-
hon. Ufford’s inte-position, whatever it
was, was certainly exceptional in those
times, and its nature may be understood
from the fact, that the same Hugh O’Neill
appears fighting against the English in
1354..-Ib2·d.

here. Dr. Lynch cannot mean' that the
King's and Queen’s Counties were the first
connum established in nelma, and go-
verned by English lam—See cupre), p. 200.

Gounty, except the Barony of Upper Os-

Ossory, and the baronies of Portnahinch

and belonged to O'Dunne and O’Dempsey.
