Charles O'Gonor may also be cited to support this opinion, for in his map he repre-
sents the Ernaan Dalfiatach of Ulster as ‘⁴ Iberi septentrionales ;” and good arguments
can be adduced to prove that those whom he marks by the different names‚--Iberi, Ernai,
Lugadih-were really branchos of the same Ithian family. It is true, he calls the Ernai
a Belgian racc, bnt 1 have never met any authority for a Belgian colony in Kerry, which,
as he allows, was one of the possessione of the Ernai Australes.

It appears, too, that ‘⁶ Dergtinnii ” or “ Dergthene,” was another alias name for the
Ithians.—-(Oyyyia, p. 268). lt is not unlike ‘⁴ Darnii,” the tribe which Ptolemy places in
that part oi Ulster, which, according to tradition, was occupied in the second century by
the Deagaidh Dalfiatach. ’

Finally, in the Eireamoriian genealogies (inst-d, p. [248] ), 1 find no names to explain
how the same tribe could be called “ Deagaidh '' and “ Dergtinne ;” but in the Ithian
genealogy (θηρία, p. 149) we have a “ Dergene,’' and a ‘⁸ Deagaidh beup5,” which
explain the common appellation, if we admit that the Deagaidh ware Ithian. The Derga
are expressly classed among the {thiam by lma Nenm'as, p. 262.

Supposing then, as very probable, the identity of the Ithian, Deagaidh, and Dalfia-
tach recca we proceed to the traditional history of the family, and the territories which
they are known to have occupied at different periods. From the Milesian conquest, South
Munster was, it is said, the territory of the Ithians3 they enjoyed, alternately with the
Eiberians of North Munster, the crown of the united provincea— Oyyyia, pp. 149, 268.
But, about fifty years before Christ, the Deagaidh invaded Munster, and drove both
Ithians and Eiberians towards the western shore—[bid. The former never recovered
their power, but were thenceforward contined nearly to the limite of the modern diocese of
Rosa (Book ⁰f Riylnts, p. 46): the latter continued to enjoy, alternately with the Deagaidh,
the provincial crown, and under Olill Olum, A. D. 237, they acquired the sovereignty of
the whole province3 Olill’s sons, Eogan and Cas, being appointed by his will heirs of the
t‘wo Munsters, and thenceforward kings, by· alternate succession, of the whole province...-

Oyyyt‘a, p. 326. “

The date of this Deagaidh invasion of Munster, and of the Dalflatach invasion of
Ulster, which preceded it by somer years ( Oyyyia, p. 266), coincides very remarkably
with the date already assigned to the establishment of the Belgas in Leinster, Meam, and
Connaught Can it be that the Deagaidh and Dalfiatach were expelled by the Belgae, and
sought other settlements ’ἓ Are there any proofs that the Deagaidh were the immediate
predecessore of the Belgoe in Tara? The reader can decide from the following data:

Suppose that we find a raee driven north and south froin Meath at a given period, and
the same race retiring to the mountains of Wicklow and Waterford‚ and broken into scat-
tered fragments in Connaught at the same time; suppose, moreover, that history records
an invasion at that time, and the growing ascendancy of the invaders in the central dis-
tricts of the island: is it not rational to infer that the dispersion of one race was the con-
sequence of the invasion of the other? Now, from comparing some of the preceding
references with the sketch of the Ithian (i. e. Deagaidh) race (Oyyyia, pp. 322, 329), it
appears that from about the first settlement of the Belgae, but especially from the destruc-
tion of the Deagaidh Conaire Mor, in his own palace, at the foot of the Dublin mountain·
