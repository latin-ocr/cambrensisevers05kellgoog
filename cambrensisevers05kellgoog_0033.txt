of the other ports of the frume, they have so exhausted the resouroes
of my countrymen ss to dsy up au the springs of weelth3 in contempt
of the wise counsel of Bion, thet a good man retiring from office ought
not to heve become more walth„ but more illustrious. N either do
we complain that in the “ Plantotion’' our enemies hove acted the pert of
Antiochus, and have worked against us thet destruction which he
planned against the Jews, when he gave orders to the commender of his
army to settle strangers in all their coasts, end to divide their lende
by Iov. We do not complaim with Tobios, ‘⁴ that we are delivered to

have heard us‚'you will grant to a devoted and loysl nation thet attention
and redress which Philip, *King of Macedon, and Adrian, Emperor of
Rome, are said to have granted to humble women, end Trajan to a
widow. You will not be outdone in humanity by the Emperor
Rodolph‚ who rebuked his courtiers when they prevented the poor from
