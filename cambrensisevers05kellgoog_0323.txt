which had not been already subjected. These two kings well 'knew that
the Irish chieftain held by treaty his lande, and the right of administe-

“ For there is no one‚’' as Cicero saJS, “who does not approve and
applaud that moral quality, which seeks not interest alone, but pre-

His perfidy, however, would be comparatively innocent, had it not
been combined with the most atrocious cruelty. He urged the exterss
