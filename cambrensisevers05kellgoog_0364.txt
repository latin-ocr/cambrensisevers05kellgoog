c Giraldus is frequently severe on the
vices of his clericsl brethren, especially the
Welsh ε “ Sicut laici et populi Walliae funes
et raptores erant rerum aliarum, sic et epis-
copi Wallenses Ecclesiarum.''—Anylia Sa-
cra, vol. ii. p. 474. Again: “ Nosse te novi
quod notum in wallia nimis est et noto-
rium, canonicos Mencvenses fere cunctos,
maxime vero Walensicos, publicos fornica·
sios et concubinarios esse sub alis Ecclesiae

.Cathedralis et tanquam in ejus gremio fo·-
carias suas cum obstetricibus et nutricibus
atque cunabulis in laribus et penetralibus
exhibentes.”-- Ibid. p. 525. The same

- vices were general and inveterate in the

cathedffil churches of Wales: “ vitiis radi·
catis olim et quasi innatis.’'—Ibid. p. 519.
‘¹ These contests are viewed in a very
different light b y other writers, especially by
Thierry, in his Norman Conquest. Giral-
dus, in his opinion, was a second St. Tho-
mas of Canterbury, contending for the liber-
ties of tthelsh Church and people against
the tyranny of England. It is true that
Giraldus was twice ,elected by the Canons
of St. David, namdy, in 1176 and in 1198

(p. 340, note b, supr-ci), and that on both
occasions he supported a long contest, by
appeals to Rome, against the English King
and clergy; but there are strong reasons
for doubt-ing whether he was iufleenced by
those motives of patriotism and uucompro-
mising hostility to English power which
Thierry attributes to him. In the first
place, Giraidus began his career in Wales,
by accepting from ,the Archbishop of Oan-
terbury a sort of legatine powers to sup-
press certain peculiar Welsh usages in the

’ diocese of St. David's (Anylia Sacra, vol. ii.

p. 47o); and by the exercise of this foreign
power he excited against himself the lVelsh
clergy and people—lbid. Again, after the
election of 1178, instead of‘suffering per-
secution and flying for protection to France,

- for his opposition to the English Court, as

Thierry assei-ts, he merely retired to the
University of Paris, to perfect himself in
his studies (ibid. p. 477), and was on his
return immediately appointed substitute for
his rival in the see of St. David’s, with every
power except that which episcopal conse-
oration confers-..Ibion p. 481. On the
