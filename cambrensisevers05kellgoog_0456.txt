¹¹ Keating gives the Irish legend of a
Simon Breac, grandson of Nemed. He
fied to Greece from the oppressive texes of
the Fomorians, and there became the pro-
genitor of the Firbolgs, who afterwards
came to Irelaud.-—p. 183. The remnant
of the Firbolgs, after the battle of Moytma,
took refuge, it is said, in the islands, where
they dwelt until· the establishment of the

Picts‚ they returned and obtained grants of

concile the supposed extirpation of the Irish
Firbolgs with an undoubted fact, their ex-

bute the introduction of the Lia-fail to the
Tuatha de Dananns. It was generally as-
serted that this Lia was transferred to Scene,
and thence, by Edward 1.‚ to westminster,
but Mr. Petris produces good arguments to
prove that it still maine on Tara Hm..-

those Dananns is myster-icus. They alu-rost

least, do not act- in a body, though the Fo-

'moriens aud Firbolgs held their ground for

centur-ies, resisting, the invaders. This is
more singular, as the Firbolgs were eompa-
ratively an uncivilized people3 they eleas]-
ed no plains (Keatiny, p. 195), and they
reigned, according to some accounts, only
