the Borumean) on Leinster⁰‚ as a penalty for the murder of his daugh-

of his reign by the treachery of Mal, King of Ulster⁶‚ A. D. 106, Α. Μ.

was deposed and slain by Fedhlimidh Reachtmor‚ A. D. 110, Α. Μ. 5309.
Fedhlimidff, sul-named Beachtmor, from “ reacht‚” law, because he 164
established many wise laws in Ireland‚ sat on the Irish throne 111110
years. Among the laws sanctioned by him, the principal was the ‘⁶ lex
talionis,” by which all in juries were punished by a similar inflictiom
thus, the malefactor who had cut off a foot 01 hand, was condemned to
lose his own foot or hand, and all other'inj uries were visited in similar
proportion on the head of the offender‘. So efficacious were those laws in

limidh looks like a golden age, when -no man, in act, look, or thought,

than the famous militia of Fingal (Finn

the Irish were poetically called Tuatha Feine
from them, and that the Fenius Farsaoidh of
the East was a legend ercet-ed on the his-

appears to me not to exist any tradition
that Phoenicians or· Carthaginians ever vi-

be proved by foreign authority), nor do our
Pagan remains imply a degree of civiliza-
tion equal to that of the Celts of Gaul before
the Roman invasion.
