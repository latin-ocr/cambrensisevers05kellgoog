ὓ Sir John Perrot received the Lord De-
puty's sword in Christ Chul-ch, June 26,
1584.. In 1582 he wrote a letter, by order
other MaJesty, on the means of suppres-
. sing the rebellion in Ireland. Finding, he
says, that St. Patrick was more familiar, and
of greater credit with the people generally,
than Christ, he proposed that the Refor-
mation should begin from God, that triers,
munke, Jesuits, pardonens3 nune, and such
like νει-111111, who openly uphold the Papacy,
should be executed by martial law. During
his administration he called for a chief
Justice from England, to be a light to the
Irish courts, which were filled, he says, for
the most part, by men ignorant of the law,
or corrupt in religion. In the Parliament
assembled at Dublin, April 26, 1585, he
attempted the repeal of Poyning's Act, but
was defeated by ι110 “ stirrers of the Pale,”
and the lawyers, who feared the repeal was
intended for other obJects than those al-
leged. In July, 1585, 110 was accused
before the Queen of this attempt, to repeal
Poyning's law, and also of requiring the
cath of supremacy, and of proposing the
same lawa as in England against recn-

sants. 'ro the first charge he answered,

· that the object of his enemies in resisting

the repeal was, because they would abide
no reformation in matters of religion ,or
State ς and that, finding them obstinate in
Parliament, he thought'the cath the best
means of trying their fidelity. The justices
of the peace also refused the oath. They
appeared to yield when threatened with the
Star Chamber, but held up their heads
again 'on support from England, for the
Queen had g1ven him a special caveat not
to tendet the cath of obedience ιο persons
of nobility and quality, and ιο forbear the
present search of this allegiance. Peri-ot
was equally obnoxious to the clergy of the
Establishcd Church, especially to the Chan-
cellor, Archbishop of Dublin, with whom
he was at varlance regarding the application
of the revenues of St. Patrick's, Yet he was
popular before the close of his aduinistra-
tion. When he was recalled, allthe genu-y
and nobility of the Pale, who had formerly
written against him, now implorati the
Quaen not to take away ‘⁶ the father of tha

poure country ;” and people came ιο Dub-
lin from' sor-ty miles to mcum his depar-
