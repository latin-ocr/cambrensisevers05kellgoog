imploring terms, to come ,home to the land and inheritance of their Α. D
father-33 they swore hythe sun and moon‚--that great oath of the -Ἀ
Pagan,—-that devoted loyalty and inviolable fidelity should be their's

for ever. The youthS, yieldi‘ng to this spontaneous offer of submission
from the Athachtuatha, joyfully returned to the land and the here-
ditary rights of their fathers. Immediately an end was made to all the
exterminating calamities of the land, and th'e earth recovered its pris-

tine fertility.

The kingdom was accordingly given to Feradhach Fiondfeetnachm, 90
during whose reign injustice of all kinds was checked‚ and justice
and equity generally flourished. This was the origin of Feradach’s
summme, as “ feachtnach’' is the Irish word for truth and integrity.
Moran¹²‚ son of Cairbre, was appointed supreme judge by the king, and
adhered inflexibly to the laws of equity. He had 'a collar endowed
with so singular a virtue, that, when worn by any judge pronouncing
judgment, or any witness giving, evidence, it would tighten round the
neck and strangle him, if he dared to depar't one hair’s breadth from
justice or truth. Whence the origin of the common saying applied to
the unwilling witneSS, it were well that Moran's collar was twined
around his neck. Feradhach died at 'Fara in the twenty-second year
of his reign, A. D. 36, A. M. 5235. ’

Fiatach Fionn0, succeeding him in the throne, was deposed and slain · 95
by Fiach Finfoladh, after a reign of three year8‚ A. D. 39, A. M. 5238.

Fiach Finfolaidh, so called from “ whitenes5,” the color for which 116
the oxen of Ireland were remarkable during his reign (“ finn,’' whitE3 ·
“ olaidh,” oxen)‚ succeeded Fiatach. Inflamed with inveterate hatred
of the Athachtuatha, on account of their former cruelties to the nobi-
lity, he imposed many galling tributeS, and exactedthem with such
seyerity that the Athachtuatha bui-ned with indignation, and resolved,
to compass his ruin by secret machinations. “ Fully aware that the
provincial-kings,-÷namely, Elimius‚ son of Conrach‚ King of Ulster3·
