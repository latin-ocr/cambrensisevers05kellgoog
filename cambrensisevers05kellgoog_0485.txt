Athachtuatha drew them into a conspiracy, and, combining their forces,

Ireland t ‘⁸ Destruere nobilem arcem Eama·
niae, votum erat qnod faciebat omnis ferox

leqom. pars i. p. clxxx.; and, finally, its
ancient glories were the theme by which,
in after ages, the Irian king excited his
followers to battle against the oppressing·
Eireamoniansz

‘⁸ The taces of Conall and Eoghan, and the
Airghialla,
Have seized on our lands,
And against them we make this onset
To drive them ‘from over us.”
..Battle of Moeyh Rath, pp. 203, 219.

Why were all fleres kings so anxious to
destroy Eamania‘? And now, in this real or
traditional rebellion, why do the Athach-
tuatha spare the palace of Eamania ¹?-why
combine with the Irians, and make one of
them their king? The answer is obvious,
if yon suppose that the Irians as well as
themselves were combining against the en·
croachments of a comparatively modern
colony in Ireland. But if the history of
the Picts, [ricla Nenm'us, p. lxxxii„ can be
relied on, then the Irians were not brothers
of Eiremonians and Eiberiam, bnt Cruithne
or Picts. The Irian Ollamh Fodhla, and
his six Irian successors, are there called the
seven Cruithnian (i. e. Pictish) kings that
ruled over Ireland. The Dal Araidhe os
Down; the Laighsh of Leix; the seven
Soghans, of Roseommon3 and the Conaille
Murtheimne, of Lonth, are also Cruithne.
Iri-21· Nenm‘us, p. lxxxiii„ and all were
Irians, ibid. p. 265. Tighernach records,
A. D. 666, the death of a king of the
Cruithne of Mesth3 and we know that

around the hill of Usneach, in that province,
there was a braneh of the Irians. Hence
it would appear that Irian and Cruithnian
are one and the same ς that they reigned in
Tara before the Eireamonians, but were
driven thence and maintained themselves
principally in Ulster, in the great palace of
Eamania. Moreover, the existence ofa great
colony of Picts in lreland is proved by ῙνίεΙι
Numine, pp. 53, 125, who asserts that the
Picts were “for a long time in Eri,” and·
“ acquired great power there ” until they
were driven out by Heremon, except some
tribes which remained in Magh Breagh.
But if we admit this great Pictish family in
Ireland, whxenee comes it that Beda, and the
metrica] legend (trista Nauius, p. 147)
represent the Picts as paying merely a flying
visit to Ireland, and why were not all the
Ultonians known as Cruithne? 1 answer,
by asking another question,-Why was all
the learning of Ussher‚ and White, and
Colgan, and Ward, required to prove that
the Scotia of the ancients was Ireland Ρ,
'l'he old title, Scoti, became the exclusive
property of the Scotoh in the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, when the power of the
true Scoti was on the wane in Ireland; so
the power of the Picts having been broken in
Ireland, by the invasion of the Eiremonian
Emai A. D. 161, by cormac Ulfada A. D.
25.4,and by the destructi-on of Eamania, A. D.
332, the glories of Pictland passed away to
Albany ; and to Bede, writing in the eighth
century, the ancient Irish Pictish kingdom
would appear to be only a dream, a mere
visit of the Picts to the country, and a
matrimonial alliance with some of its inha-
bitants. The Cruithne, dispersed through
