Non· does Girsldus’s account of the benefits accruing from s visit to
the Purgatory agree with that of Henry. The latter relatas that our
Saviour uppem-ed to St. Pati-icit, and addreesed him thur: ‘⁴ sny person
truly peniteat, and nrmed with true saith, enter-ing this pit, and spend-
ing one night end day in it, shall be clesnsed from all the sins of his
whole life, and 8111111 even, ss he posses through it, behold not only the
toi-ments of the wicked‚ but also, if he has constently acted through
saith, the joys of the blessed„”‘¹ Giraldus’s account is very different from
that3 for, while he states that persons spending a night in the pit would
be tormented by evil spirits, he omits altogether the delightful expe-
rience of the joys of heaven. He assei-ts, moreover, that ‘⁴ any person
suffering those toi-ments once, by the injunction of his confessor, will
never incur the psius of hell, unless he relapso into more grievous sins 3⁹⁹
insinusting, thereby, thet if the Purgatory were ι sels-imposed penenee
no advantage would be derived from it. N ow, as it hes never been
heard of, stom the crestion of Adam, that any man was induced by the
solicitations ‘of others to ,s‘ubj ect himself to such dresdful horrore (on
