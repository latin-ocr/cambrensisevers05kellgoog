os sailors? ⁸⁴ Men educated in ships are generally rude, and ignorant
of liberal manners, and of the common sense of mankind. For the sailor
class is like its own element, being far removed from the society of civi-
lized men.” The manners of the seilor are rustic and uncouth, and fick le
es the clement on which he lives; he is carried away by every bresth
of hope and fem-3 and, in the story of his adventures, is guided less by
truth than by the testes of his audience. It is, moreover, very im-
probable thet sailors took the trouble of ascertaining the religious prin⁴
ciples of an obscure tribe; money and traffic being generally the object
of their conversations and inquiry. Agein, ss Giraldus adduces no v‘vit-
nesses but “ his own countrymen,” is there any injustice in supposing

around him were strolling mummers, swindlers, hostlerS, and penny—

· The Primste of Ireland was, therefore, too mild when he stigmatized
Girsldus merely as being “ rather unj ust toIrelsnd and her inhabitants?
'that was not the criticism of some of Girsldus’s own contemporaries. He
complains most bitterly that the Topogrsphy, his respectable work, was
the butt of envy and calumny. The first and second distinctions dis·
armed jealousy itself, and shsmed and forced it to admire( But against
the third distinction its fangs were insolently brandished„ ‘⁸ He tells

half 013 of a woman with a long besrd, and of s buck-goat and lion'

himself by an appesl to the omnipotence of God, ss if all the prodigies
he relates should necessarily be facts, because they did not exceed the
limits of God’s omnipotence. He must either have 'forgotten or never
known that axiom familiar to every tyro in Dialectics‚ ‘⁶ a potentia sd
