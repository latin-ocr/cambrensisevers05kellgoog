descended. On Gerald’s death, she was married again to Stephen‚ War-
den of the Castle vof Aberteiffe and had a son, Robert Fitzstephen.” Ge-
rald of Windsor had by the same Nesta a daughter also, called “ Auga-
reth‚” who was mother to Giraldus cambrensis. Giraldus was, therefore,
nephew to Fitzstephen, whom he calls “a 11011 of N esta.” In another
place, he expressly calls himself “ nephew of Fitzstephen.” He also
states that Raymond was son of an elder brother of Maurice and Fitz·
stephen. 1 think that dder brother was the son of fleury, whom
N esta bore to the King of England¹. Meyler¹¹² and Robert Barry¹² were
also nephews ofFitzstephen, one by a brother, the other by a sieten the
former was cousin of Raymond‚ the latter a brother of Giraldus Bai-ry.
Hence the persons whom he has hitherto praised were either his cousins
αι· his uncle8.” Now we come to the rose water he lavishes⁶ on his
brother Robert: ‘⁴ Among the many indicatione of his virtue, the most
singular were, that no violence, however unexpected, no surprise, no
sudden movement was ever known to coward him into despair, or to
drive him to an. ignominious ssight, or to shake his coura-ge. He was
always prompt in assistance, and ready for the field. The highest valor
is that which is able to ward off evil, and to face it should it come on.’

He celebrates him· 111 another stram, in a different passage in the same
chapter, as a mafi eminently distinguished for genuine valor, neither
ambitious of praise nor pandering for popular applause3 his ambition
was to be, rather than appear to be, a leader among 1118 best; for kind
11811118 had endowed him with all the modesty of a young girl, opposed
alike to beasting and loquacity3 he neither extolled his own great deeds
nor wished to hear them extolled by others; and hence the less ambi-
tious of glory he appeared, the more liberally was it conferred on him.’'
FinaHy, including both in a common eulogy, he exclaims: “In every

Philip Bai-ry, his brother, with whom -he
came to Ireland. “ In the same passage,”
he says, “ also came Gir-aldus (another ne-
phew of Fitzstephen‚ aud brother to Philip

Bau-ry), who, with his good advice and·

counsel, did very much pleasure, and help
both his uncle and brother; for he was
learned, and a great traveller in searching

to leam the site and nature of that land.”

scendants of this Philip, for their valent,

all the rest, for the most part, Irish.”—
