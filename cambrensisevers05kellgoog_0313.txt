sess that they compiled them from public documents. Ammianus de-
clares that his antiquities of the Gauls were taken from their national
archives. Arrian, tec, states, in the first page of 1118 book, that he
had read the unpublished commentaries of King Ptolemy, who took an
active part in the whole reign of Alexander the Great. Metasthenes and
‚Ctesias appeal to the public monuments of the Persians, while Appian
declares he read the secret commentaries of AugustuS, and Diodorus
the secret mysteries of the Egyptians. Thucydides supported, at great
cost, a staff of experienced and learned men to aid him in his reseas-chesn
and, not to mention that Dionysius and Diodorus used the same diligence
in their Roman history, we have. St. J erome declaring that his pilgri-
,mage to Palestine, and the co7operation of profound Hebrew scholare,
had been mos't useful to him in understanding the scripture. Dis7.
puted questions on the interpretation of Scripture were referred to him.

the most difficult texts, on account of his great learning and his pro-

sound knowledge, not only of the Greek and Latin, but also of the κ

Hebrew and Chaldaic languages. Very different was the plan adopted
by Giraldus3 he never thought of taking the trouble to learn the Irish
.language; he does not intimate such an intention in any part of his
work, though he ,never loses an opportunity of extolling his diligence.
His stay in Ireland, t00, was not sufficiently protracted to give him
even a meagre acquaintance with the Irish tongue. He was in Ireland
twice3 first in company with his brother Philip and 1118 uncle Stephen,
“ whom he boasts to have helped by his advice3 next, as tutor to Prince
John, who had not then attained his twelfth year0. The precise-date os
these two voyages we must guess from other sourceS, for he does not
give in any part of his work the least clue to decide them, though he
ought to have known “ that neither truth nor hi'storical weight can be
expected from those historiens whose chronology 18 deficient or incon-
sistent„ Moreover he never set his foot on two-thirds* of Irelandd. He
would not yenture his person in a hostile country, where, to use his
own words, ‘⁶ the captured were decapitated, not ransomed, but de-
