plore you in the words of the poet τ “ Save us, O! uneonquered hert),
from those e‘vils, and grant us peace.” ‘⁴ Deliver me from my necessi·
ties.” May you endeavour to raiae this weight of affliction from your
Irish subjects; to bring them from slavery to liberty3 from exile to
their country 3 from the outcast’s roamings to a fixed and certain home;
from a stringet land to the land of their fathers3 “and do justice and

ο judgment, and deliver him that is oppressed by violence out of the
hands of the oppressum„

’ As the glory οι· infamy of a father is inseparable from that of his
children, so it is with the prinee and his subjecte. The men who ure
plotting our destruction are the mol-tal enemies of your name. Arise,
then, sun of our fortune, end seatter, with the benign beams os thy

splendour, the clouds that obscure the brillianey of your own name, and ·

are rapidly consigning αε to the dark night of ruin and infamy. Do
not be offendedif I present to you the neked truth on the state of our
affaire, which has so often been disguised, or dressed in false colom-s,
by the prejudieed nceounts of our enemies, but which you behold here,
simple, candid, and in her own naked majesty, without the false eom-
plexion or artifieial eurls of deceptiom reeording plain facts, not from
malevolence towards our enemiw, to whom I wish well, but for the good
of my conum-ymen, who are deterre'd by their tyrants at home from
raising their voieeffl. Their very tem-s, they know, would be punished as
rebellione, and, therefore, their grin is the more deeply seated, as it is
more violently repressed. I, however, being fer from my native land,
and out of the power of her gova-nors, prefer the danger of publio re-
monstranoe to criminal silen0e⁸.· Duty imperatively requires ‘'‘ that we
cannot but speak the things which we have seen and · heard.” 1 have
zealousky embraced the opportunity of laying before you an unvarnished
statement of some only of the miseries of my countrymen‚ in the hope
that some of them at least may be redressed, and may not atrike their
inveterate roots into the heart of my country. The address of St. Am-
brose to the Emperor Theodosius, Ι feel assui-ed, has taught you, that

“ Libertas etenim quovis non venditur “ Fit, voees ardet carpere nemo meas. ..
auro. ο At quando nostro quid acerbius exci-
Ηίο, mihi dicendi quicquid libet ampla dit ori
potestas In patriis oris, carptor iniquus αἰῶν’
