Keogh and Kehoe‚ of Mac Fhaelain, now
obsolete‚ and of O'Brei‘n, now O’Byrne or
Byme. The Ili-Faelain occupied the plains
of Magh Laighgean and Magh Liffe„ about

the northern half of the present county of '

Kildara—Book of Mylan, pp. 205, 206.

[Β This is incorrect. It should be “ Mac
Gormain, lord of Ui-mBairche.’' The Ui-
mBeirche were seated in the present barony
of Sliabhe Maii-ge or Slievemarague, in the
Queen's County.--Ib.‚ p. 212, note ¹²².

0 Now O' Gonor. This name is misplaced
by Dr. Lynch. It should precede 0’ Mur-
chadhain‚ as remarked in note k.

Ρ Mac ‚Gillaphraduig now anglicised Pitt-
patrick.

(Ι Now O'Carroll‚ or Can-011, without the
, prefix o’. He‘was seated in a'ferffle dis„

. trict, in the barony of Gabhran or Gowran,

in the county of Kfflzenny, extending §rom
Oill Chainnigh, now Kilkenny‚ to Sliabh
gCaithle. The O'Carrolls of this racc cannot

, now be easily distinguished from those, os

Eile Ui GheaerbhailL in the King’s County.

¹¹ Now anglicised Dunphy. He was seated
in Gabhran, nent the River Bearbha‚ or
Barrow. Donnchadh O’Donnchaidh, - a
name which would now be anglicised Denis

¹ Dunphy‚—-the head of this family, erected

the abbey of Jerpoint in 1180. Ware and
Archdall call him “ Donogh O’Donoghoe.”
⁸ Now Ossory. This ancient principality

, comprised the barony of Upper Ossory in the '

Queen's Oounty, and nearly the entire of the
present county of Kilkenny. There is every

reason to believe that,- since the establish-
mbnt of christianity in Ireland, its limita
never extended beyond those of the present
diocese of Ossory3 but it is stated by Kest-
ing and others, that in the time of Aenghus
'‘Osrai‘dheach this territory comprised the
whole region extending from Sliabh madh-
ma to the sea at waterford, and from the
Bearbha- or Barrow, westwards‚ to the Siuir‚
or River Suir. -See Book of Βίρήέε, pp. 17,
18, note⁸

⁸ Now Broder and Broderick. 'He was
chief of Ui· mre, dat. pl. Uibh· Eirc, now
the barony of Iverk‚ in the south of the
county of Kilkenny. ·

”Now Breen. The Triucha— na— golam
is included in the present barony of Knock-
topher, in the county of Kilkenny.

w Now Brennan. He was chief of Ui-
Duaoh, which is designated by Triucha-un—

Chomair‚ from Comar, now Castlecomer, its ⁴

head residem Ui--nuach is described by
th-Uidhrin, in his topographical poem, as
Ριοηηὸῑάῃ parm-1115 no peom e, i. e. the
fair extensive plain of the River Feoir, now
the Nore. This is the last territory mentioned
by O'Dubhagain. The remainder of the list
is obtained'from Gina-na-naemh 0⁹11- meh-
rin’s topographical poem, thougli Dr. Lynch
seems >to have thought that O'Dubhagain
was the author of both poems. xO'h-Uidh-
rin, who died in 1420, states, in the open—
ing of his poem, that O’Dubhagain, who
described the tribes and temwfies of Leaen-
Chuinn, neglected those of Leath-Mhogha,
