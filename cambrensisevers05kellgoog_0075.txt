most sovereign contempt, as if they were the most miserable of men,
especially the nobles, some of whom were treated to their faces with the
most opprobrious indignities and oppressed with intolerable injurieS,
while others were even subjected, like menial slaves, to corporal punish-
ment by those vulgar upstarts, whose licentious insolence must have been
to ‘⁶ good men more intolerable than cruelty itself,” “ for to add insult
to injury is the last excess of hunian depravity.’' Τοο evident it is, that
our nobles “ have hed trials of mockeries and stripes, moreover‚ also of
hands and prisone ;’' and should even a look betray the indignant feel-
ings of their souls at those contumelies of their insulting tyrants (like
the Romans under the gibbet at Caudium), they had the sword or the
bastinado brandished to their face.

Universal and unbounded satisfaction was given by your proclama·
tion of pardon to all who had not been guilty of notorious murderS,
and also by your promise of restoration to many who had been driven
from their paterna] property by the tumults of war. No other monu-
ment of your clemency could be inore acceptabless. But, to use the words
of Cicer0‚ “ what avails it that the impartial administration of J ustice
be strictly ordered by you, if those to whom you have delegated the
function do not carry it into execution ?” The very favours which you
grant are instantly taken from ,us by your ministers in Ireland‚ who
distort the words of your proclamation into interpretatione so strange
as to nullify is, with the design, no doubt, of provoking you? indigna-
tion. The very men who were empowered by you to take possession of
the property of their fathers have been either excluded from posses-

bution out of their estates, it they did
but reside in the Irish quartem, although
in their own houses, not only these, I
say, were decim-ed to be no innocents, but
such as lived au the war—time in Eng-
land, such ss were with his Majesty at
Oxford, and set-ved in his army, if they rea
ceived any rent from their tenants in Ire-
land, were, by virtue of one of the eleven

noeence, viz„ all who joined the catholic
Confederates before 1646, and all who, at
any time, adhered to the Nuncio against
Ormonde, were declared ‘⁸ nocents,” διο.
Notwithstanding the strictness of these
mles the number of innocente restored was
so great that standford, Allen‚ and other
Cromwellian officere, made a plot to seize
the Castle of Dublin, and overturn the Go-

qnalifications, to be held for “nocents.''- vemment- The House of Commons pro-
