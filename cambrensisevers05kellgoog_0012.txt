learning, or a great-er amount of good accomplished‚ tlgan in the
first half of the seventeenth century. That literary period stands
· alone in our history, and, in its own order, it may well beata
comparison with the contemporary literature of other countries.

The' personal history of Dr. Lynch is unfortunately almost
unknown, or known only from the dates of his workS, though he
maintained epistolary correspondence with some of his learned
contemporarieS, and has given us some finished sketches of the
political events and characters of his time, Unlike his famous
antagonist, who compiled‚ in his fiftieth year, an elaborate and·
highly eulogistic autobiography, he aHudes but three times to j
himself in the Cambrensis Eversus. It was only in the evening
of his dayS, broken down by age, the sorrows of exile, and the
ruin of his country, that a pressing invitation to return to Ireland
drew from him a touching letter, which, with some meagre notes
collected from other sources), are the only materials for a sketch
of his life.

He was born in Galway‚ and descended from a family* whose ἱ
fame is written in all the monuments of that ancienttown. The
Lynches claimed descent from Hugh de Lacy, one of the most
successful of the first race os Anglo-Norman invaders. With the
exception, perhasz, of the WhiteS‚—an exception admitted by
Dr. Lynch himselfi—no family gave a greater number of distin·
guished ecclesiastica to the Irish Ohurch. '

There is no direct authority to fix the precise year of his birth;
but, from some incidental source5‚ we may infer safely that he was
born before the year 1600. He arrived in France a little after the
completion of his seventeenth year, and was engaged in the study
of humanity at· Dieppe in 1618. He was near· sixty years of age
when composing the Cambrensis EversuS, which, though not pub· '
lished until 1662, must, from intrinsic evidence, have been com·
posed before the Restoration in 1660. From these dateS, and col·
lateral evidence, it appears he was born before 1600‚-pr0bab1yin

1599.
