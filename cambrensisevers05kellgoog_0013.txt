He was educated by the Jesuits, and, with that fidelity which
has generally characterized their scholare, he omits no opportu-
nity of defending them, especially for the part taken by them in
the affairs os the confederata Catholics‚ 1642. While persecution
was at its height, the Jesuits lived in the houses of the Catholic

nobles; but as soon as it began to relax, they rented houses in
several towns, Galway amongoihers, where Dr. Lynch received
the firs‘t rudiments os learning. Galway was, at that period, and
for many year8‚ the sec-ond town in Ireland, and, in some pointS, the
rival of Dublin. So early as 1608, Alexander Lynch, who is tra-
ditionally said to have been father os our author, had no less than
1200 schol-ars from all parts os Ireland‚ even from the other towns,
and the Pale. In 1615 the'school was suppressed by Ussher,
who has given a high character of the masten but the suppres-
sion was only temporary3 for it is probable that, notwithstanding
the enactment osa penal Statute in 1634, Galway was never with-
out a Catholic school down to the capture of the town by Crom-
well's forces. It appears, from Dr. Lynch's workS, that Nicholas
Skerrett, Archbishop of Tuam, and other dignitarieS, had taught
school there in the worst timcs; thus combining‚ like many of their
colleagueS, whenever it was practicable‚ the two professione of

schoolmaster and priest.

many years our author remained in France, or in what colleges he
graduated3 but he was probably ordained priest about the year
1622, for he had labored thirty years on the Irish mission before
1652. He had celebrated mass “in secret places and private
houses'' before the opening of the Catholic churches in 1642. Like
many of his predecessors in Galway, he taught school, and acquir‘ed
a great reputation for classical learning.

Though Dr. Lynch felt acutely the restriction on the public
exercise of his worship during nearly twenty years, and expresseS,
in glowing langnage, his emotions on first celebrating mass iu the ·
churches during the ten years from 1642 to 1652, 116 never speaks
