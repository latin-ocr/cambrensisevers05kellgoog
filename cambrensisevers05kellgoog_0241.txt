English arms on the Irish battle-field. Such is usually the case with
' invaders in the first flush of conquest: thus Dido says,

‘⁶ My cruel fato
Compcls ma thus to guard my unsettled state.”

But that time could not slacken or cool down the fiery ardor of this
hatred, that English obstinacy should be eternal, is truly astonishing.
N ever, since the creation of the world, were hostile feelings so syste-
matioally kept alive sor such a length of time in any other nation. The
policy of the Romans, we know 'from innumerable authorities, was of
quite a different character. For by the subjugation of many nations‚
barbarous and civilized, they learned by experience the best mode of
completing and consolidating their conquests. How barbarous or un-
civiliaed soever the enemy might be, he was admitted to a participation
of Roman rights and institutions when he became a Roman subject3 and
was not excluded from protection so long as he was faithful in his alle-
giance. It was said of Julius Caesar, “ that the'same hand that conquered ‘
protected the conquered.” And another emperor was thus addressed:

‘⁴ Of many nations thou hast formed one state3

Reluctant captives bless their happy fatet
Rome o’er the conque-red earth her laws extends-3

And thus the world with the city blends.”
Δ “ What now would be our empire,” asks Seneca, “ if a politic fore· ”
sight had not moulded the victors and vanquished into one people ἲ
Romulus, our founder (as Claudius says in Tacitus), was so consum-
mate a politician, that most of his enemies became his citizens on the
very day of battle.” The exclusion os the conquered from the rights of
citizenship was the most fatal defect in the political system of the Spar-
tans and Athenians3 while, on the other hand, the Roman power was
extendes by the admitting of enemies ιο the freedom of Rome, as Livy
assures ηε, and as indeed is sufficiently obvious from the history of the
Sabines, Albans, Latins, and other states of Italy, and even of Gaul,
which were installed in the senate by the hand of their conquerors.
Cerialis, in his oration to 'the Gauls (according to Tacitus), tells them:
‘⁶ Our legions are generally under your command3 you govern these and
other province83 there is no exclusion, no bar against your promotion.
Let us therefore love and enj oy that rank and peace to which victors

and vanquished have the same legal right.”
