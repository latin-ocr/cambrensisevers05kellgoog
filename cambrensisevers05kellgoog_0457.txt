because far the greater part of his history is a tissue of lies, has been A. c.
too true to his general character in almost all the particulare he relates 'T'-
of Symon Brauon. Symon was not born in Spain; he reigned six, not
forty years, and at a different date3 nor had he any successore such as
those whom Boetius assigna to him. N either was he the person who
‚brought the stone of destiny to Ireland, as Boetius says3 it was brought
here by the Tuatha de Dananns⁰‚ as our native historiens essert, who
are better authorities on such subjects than a man who has fallen into
gross errors even in the history of his own country. They deny that
Spain-was the birth-place of Symon, and mark a different date for his
reign, and successore and genealogies different from those shadowy names
mentioned by Boetius. He is right when he maintains that the Irish

are of‘Spanish origin1³3 but errs egregiously when he says that, “ Cor·

superior racc, and reigned in Ireland‚ ac· Pillars of Hercules along the western shore,
cording to all accounts, 197 years. From and bequeathed their name to the north-

this it appears that, if the Dananns ever
existed, they were only a small body of in-
vaders, er, what is more probable, that they
figure nuder a different name in the subse-
quent traditione of the nation. In some
points they arc like the Cruithnc3 both land
in the North3 both had “ bright poems‚''
“ necromancy‚” and ‘⁸ well-walled honses.”

(KeatingJ, p. 209) are like those in Irish

Ρ This is the constant tradition of the
frisii, and there was nothing in the rela-
tions between Spain and Ireland, before the
sixteenth century, which might induce the
latter to claim the relationship. Spain was
‘the only country in Western Europe which
was not visited by Irish ecclesiastice from
the fifth to the twelfth century. 1 know
not one instance of an Irishtnan acquiring
a name there. It is certain, on the other
hand, that, some 1200 or 1600 years before
Christ, Spain was invaded by the Ganls,
who gradually· extended their sway to the

western peninsula, Gallik or Galicia. -·-

Some say the notion of a Spanish colony
originated in a confusion of the words Ha·-
berm’a and Iberia. But was it by a similar
blunder that Ptolemy places the Concani,
Luceni, and other Spanish tribes, on the
south of Ireland. -— O'Conor, Proleqom.
pars i. p. 41, et seq. If we admit Irish
tradition as conclusive evidence that the
Firbolgs and Dananns came from Britain,
why not admit the same tradition for the
Spanish colony, especially when that tra-
dition existed centuries before national ha—
tred would prompt the Irish to disown a
British origin. If Tacitus speak nuth, that
Irish ports were better known in ancient
times than the British‚ or, at least, well
known, it is easy to explain how a colony
could pass over from Spain. The number and
civilization of those colonists are another
questiong our own belief is, that whether
they were superior or inferior to their Bii-
tish neighboura they appear not .to have
been so civilized as >their brother Celts of
