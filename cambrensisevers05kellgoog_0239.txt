”Ρωιίεοα1 as a capital felony‚ but by a fine called an eric, according to
the rule ofthe Irish law‘. Davis produces several instances to corrobo-
rate these facts, “ For it is manifest,” he says, “ that such as had the
goverument of Ireland under the crown of England did intend to make
a perpetual separations and enmity between the English and the Irish‚
pretending‚ no doubt, that the English should in the end root out the
Irishh; which, the English not being able to do, caused a perpetual war
between the natione, which continued four hundred and odd years¹,
and would have lasted to the world’s end.'' Victory decided alternately
for the contending parties; nor did either party renounce the battle
until J ames L ascended the throne&

During the first heats of martial conflict between the two natione,
Ι am not all surprised‘ that English hatred of Ireland was as fierce as

hanuet, according ιο the varying interests equal to the expense, that the whole adja-

commencement. ⁸

J Ope of the obstacles to the· speedy re-
duction of laland, according to Sir John
Davis (Dirces-try, p. 132), was, that the
invaders did not castellate the woods and
mountains, and drive the natives into the
plains. The bogs and forests were the sole
strongholds of the natives in many places.
The Statute of Kilkenny, A. D. 1296,ι gives
a lively picture of the border werras-e, and
proves that even then the English power
was declining in districts where it· had been
previously established. “The Irish‚'’ the
statute says, “trusting in their thick fo—
reetsand deep begs, are becomingmore
audadous, especially since the King‘s high-
way is, in many places, closed up by the
napid growth of the foreste, and made im-
passable even to pedestrians.” As the Irish
retr-ested securely to these bogs and woods‚
it was ordered “that the lord of the forest,
through which the King’s highway ran of
old (‘ ab antiquo’)‚ should keep the read
clear, or, if he and his tenants were not

cent territory should be assessed for the pur-
pose.” The payment of guides for the Eng-
lish hostings into Irish tcrritories‚ namely‚
“ guidagio” and ‘⁸ spiagio,” was a heavy
item in Pale expendituro. - navis, Hier.

wax-fare, we may mark the fate of three
castles: the castle of Sligo, built in 1245

great error to suppose that they had a com—
bined plan of operatione against the English.
