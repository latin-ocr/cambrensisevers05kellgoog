ded Connaught into six connties, he never
sent any justices of assiae tovisit that pro-

gova-ned it only in a course of discretion—

who named judges, justices of the peace,

‘ p. 88. According ιο Davi«, except Felim

O’Conor, O’Brien was the only Irish chief-
talu, before the sixteenth century, who had
hislands nnderagrantfrcmthsCrown. The
grant was given, in 1221, in the minority
cf Hem-y 111.-p. 111. Dating fnum that
period, the 100 years mentioned by Finglas
bring us to Bruce's invasion. But it is
highly improbable that the tribute was
paid regularly, if at all. -Before 1221,
namely‚ in 1185 and 1192, the English
had ean-led off some plunder from Tho-
mond. In 1207 they attempted ιο build
a castle at Killaloe‚ but were defeated3 and
O’Brien an Tleyve destroyed the castles of
Birr, Kinetty‚ Lorrah, and Ballyroan. In
1213[0 ‘?], the English built a castle at
Rusones, rebuilt those of Kinetty and Birr
in 1214, and sncoeeded, in 1216, in build-
ing the castle of Killaloe, and compelling
the people ιο take an Enth bishcp. In
1225 we find Doncugh Cairheach O'Brien
in alliance with the English against the
Irish of Connaught3 but ten years later hc
opposes them, but is defeated, and gives
hostages. In 1257, the O’Briens defeat

the English of Mnnster and Connanght. ‘ l
