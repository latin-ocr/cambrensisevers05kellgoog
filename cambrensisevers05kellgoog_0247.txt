legae in which the Irish youth would have cultivated their talenta,
that when a proposal was⁸mede on that subject, in the English Genucii,
even in Catholie timee2 it was vehemently opposed by oue of the prin-
eipnl members of Parliament, who was himself a celebrated Catholie
biehop. When interrogated on the matter, by a person who expressed
his astonishment, how a Catholie bishop could obstruet· eo useful and
holy a projeot, he answeress‘ ‘that when he gave his vote in Couneil
against the projecit, he acted not as a Catholie bishop, but as a member
of the English Parliamentq. ’² This, perhaps, might answer very welh

if, when the Couneil of God and hie saints pronounoed the severe sen-

tence on the bishop, the same subtle distinction eould save the senator.
But to return to Divis: ‘⁴ 1f‚’.’ he sayS, “the English eould neither in
peaee govern the Irish by ' law, nor eould in ,war root them out by the
”roi-d, must they not need be prieks in their eyes and thorns' in their
sides till the world’s end· and eo the conquest be never brought to per-

fection.” ·

The blame of this perennial discor-d cannot be thrown upon the
Irish‚ who often petitioned the King of England‘ most earnestly to be

arrested and impr-isoned by the royal offi-
oeta, they were mult, mys O'Neill, in such
'abjeet sear, that they dated not complain

' That the Iriah would voluntnffly eur-

render their own lawa for those of England,
no inan, who knows their history, ean be-
lieve. Tho numerous patente os denimtion
cited by Davi& aa granted by the Crown to
native Iriah at their requeat, are uo pmofs
of any sueh general widi, until it is proved
that the petitionem, were not nativos of the
English districts. In those districts, men
would naturally wieh to have the protec-
tion of English lavfr ; but that all the na-
tive Irish eighed‚ aa Dr. Lyneh says, during
centuries, to be delivered from the yoke of

the Brehons, does not appear from our his-
tory. Dinis, whom Dr. Lyneh follows,

asserta that for “ 200 years, at least,” after

the Ιιινιιεὶοιι, that is, until 1372, the Irioeh
would glndly have embraced English law,
implying thereby that they were not of the
same opinion in subsequent times. But it
would be more true to say that, from the
early part of the reign of Edward 1., A. D.
1272, down to the murder of the Earl ol
Ulster in 1833, the irish would generally
accept with gratitude English law, because,
during that period, they were reduced very
low. *They offered 8000 marks ιο Ed·-
