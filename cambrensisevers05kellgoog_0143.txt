thropgh a vast estuary into the western Oeean, below Cnoc Patruic,

them with tremendous noise‚ and the cataracte obstruet the navigation

Giraldna it is evident‚ must have been raving or dreaming when he
statoe that the Shannon divides Ulster from Connaught, and discharges
itself into the Nol-thern Oeean, unless it may be ,urged in defenee of
his false account, that, when -he wrote, the river held that coursel ,
who ean deny, it may be said, the extraordinary changes which have
occurred from the beginning of the world ἲ who will *say the waters

of that river have not retired from their former bed, and abandoned it ’

to the occupatiori of man? Mountains, Ι admit, have sometimes sunk
down, and driven off the waves of theocean. Fertile plains have been
so blasted by fire that they afterwards ‘defied all attempta at cultivation.
Earthqnakes have often engulphed whole cities and their inhabitants.
Many tracte, once covered with mountains, are now level plains‚ and
among all the agents of those revolutione of our earth, the most power·
ful is water, which novv floats the keel over many places once furrowed
by the plough. Many similar changes are attested by the evidence of
history. But that the Shannon ever changed its course, you have
neithe'r a hint from history, nor a sign on the surface of the land. Can

correct a poetic lieense of Mt. Moere. In his
well-known song of ‘⁴ st. Senanne and the
Lady‚” he makes ‘⁴ legenda hint ” that ir
the fair intrudat had delayed until morn-
ing, she never would have left Iniscatteryss
The legend really says she never did leave
it. she was a cousin of St. Senanus, and

a nun named canneta (Cunnera ), who<
wished to receive before her death the hely ⁶·

communionum his hands, and to leave
lm bonon in his island. Aster‘ some re-
monstrance he consented, but she died im·-
mediateiy. oolgan wm oen the rest: “ she
is bened, as she wished (in the island), on
the bank of the Shannon3 and her tomb, as

she mmmm, has not only been respected by ·

the *ωηο of ‘the river, but it has been re·-

marked, that all who piously make a pil-
griinage to that tomb, when they are going
on a voyage, return home ease and sound
from the <langere of the deep.”--Acta SS„
p. 536, xl. Even at the present day all
the trading beate in the river sail round
the island on the day they are launched.
The fishing boatu observo the same oere-
mony on the first day of the fishing sesson.

They lower the sails at five staticus, but χ

cast anehor opposite the nun’s tomb. Au
boats passing up or devm the Shannon, at
all times, lower the sails at the nun’s tomb

only. The Vory Rev. J. Kenny, V. G., Kil- ’

laloe, towhom Ι am indebted for those facts,
states ,that the name of the nun is not pre-
served by tradition.
