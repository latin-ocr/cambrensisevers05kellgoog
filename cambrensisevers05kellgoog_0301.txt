I know that I have destroyed the beauty of this poem by presenting
its detached fragments in such a confused order3 just as all beauty and
‚ order departs from the stone structure when the union of its compo-
nent parts has been dissolved. Nevertheless I could not resist the
temptation of publishing a document which gives so authentis an ac-
'count of the families settled in Ireland before the English invasion.
Most of the familias mentioned in that poem were not only existing
about the commencement of the late war, but some of them were even
still occupying a portion of their old territories‚ and others enjoyed
most extensive estates'.

I read in a certain document an accurate account of the journey of
certain commissioners sent by Sir John Perrott through C'onnaught and
Thomond in the year 1585, for the purpose of fixing the cess and rent
that was tc be paid to the Queen and the old proprietors·. In that whole
circuit there was scarcely a single territory in which the commissioners ,
did not find some family of Irish origin producing its roll of ancient
tribute; a fact which may be also inferred clearly enough from the
author of the “ Death and Deeds of Sir John Perrott.” As for Ulster‚
, so far were the English from subduing it, that no one either of the
Catholic or Protestant Kings of England ever nomin‘ated or presented
,a Bishop to any of the three Ulster dioceses of Derry, Raphoe, or

Kilkenny. The Irish names in that eounty
were O'Brennan of Idouglu O'Ryans, and
O’Shees. The last family, who removed
from Iveragh, in the west of Kerry, in the
fourteenth century, had a very large pro·
-perty in the city of Kilkenny. Far the
richer and lar-ger portion of Munster was
held¹ by the English race, especially lVater·
ford, South Tipperary, Ἐκεῖ (tout, Lime-
rick, &c. ἔω. “
⁸ The inquisitione to which Dr. Lynch
refers are published by Mr. Hau-dimane-
Iar· Οοπηαειρήε, p. 303r ει seq. They give

the names of the actual proprietate, the
extent of their territorias, the rent which
they then compounded to pay to the Queen
per quai-ter (120 acres), the portione which
they received free, and the church and ab·
bey landa. The latter, which, in the county
Mayo alone, amounted to nearly 7000 acres,
were, of course, seized by the Oroi-1311, and
distributed among the royal favorites. The
church lands, in the same ccunty, were then
nearly 20,ooo acres. The inquisitione and
the levying of cess were one of the chief
causes of Irish wat-s under Elizabeth.
