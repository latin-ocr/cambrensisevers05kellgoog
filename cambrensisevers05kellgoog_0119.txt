hope of recovering it, and giving it to the public. Philip O’Sunivand
else, a man of noble birth, and justly celebrated for his litei-ary services
to Ireland. entered the lists chivalrously against Giraldus, as we learn
from the following linae of a poem prefixed to the Decades of St. Patrick.
Enumerating the works of Philip, it states:

⁴⁸ ² ‘⁴ The spawn of jealousy, the enormem lies,
Or Gerald, he refutes.”

After the labors of these two illustrious men, in refuting ,Giraldus,
men so' profoundly versed in the history of Ireland, 1 sear it may appear
, like a work of supererogation, on my part, to go over the same ground
in vindicating my country against the aspersions of her slanderer3 espe-
cially as Ι am confident (though I never inspected their works) that their
task must have been executed in so masterly and perfect a style, as 'to
make it a crime in me to apply my inferior abilities to their theme.
But it afflicta me that their works are not published and studied by the
learned, in order to block-up that poisoned spring whence all other
writers, who hate Ireland, imbibe th eir envenomed calumnies⁹.

Yet, Ι do not intend, nor, in truth, have 1 either the ability or the
leisure to refute, in detail, the calumnies of cambrensis against my
country-mem that, I have no doubt, has been ably done by these two
great pillars of their country. They reaped the harvest; I glean the
acattered ear: and if I single out some only of those errors of Giraldus
which totally destroy his authority, it is with the view that our silence
should not be taken as an acknowledgment that he had not violated
that truth, which, however tarnished with the rust of ages, must now,

, to the delight of all, come forth from the ordealof discussion more pure

and brilliant, like tried gold from the furnace. For such is the nature
of truth, that it cannot be so weakened as to disappear for a conside-
rable time from the eyes of men-3 it cannot be sullied by the assaults
of its adversaries3 nor can its majesty be, in the slightest degree, im—
