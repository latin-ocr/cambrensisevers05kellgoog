them. A most conclusive proof of the sacrilege against the ehurch is,
that “ Hamo deValois, and other justices of Ireland‚ the attendants of
John, brother o‘f Richard‚ King of England, inflicted great injuries· on
John (lumin, Archbishop of Dublin3 the Archbish0p‚ rather than allow
such outrages on himself and on his church to go unpunished‚ preferred
going into exile, excommunicated the above-named criminaIS, and laid
his archdiocese under an interdict.’' Hoveden gives a more detailed
account of this matter. He εἴωθε, among other thingS, that a crucifix
in Dublin was covered over with a profuse sweat‚ and poured tears from
its eyeS, and blood from its sidea, God himself manifesting by this pro-
digy, his detestation of the atrocious outrage. And here I may re·-
mark that Giraldus was deficient in the duty of a historiali, for, though
he tells us ‘⁶ that this John would exalt to an eminent degree the state
of the Irish Church‚ if sword had not been opposed to sword‚ the State
to the clergy, and envy' to virtue‚’' still he does not give the whole
history in detai13 he rather suggests than boldly denounces the atro-
city of the crimes, lest perhaps he might incur thereby the wrath of the
perpetratorsb. The fact, however, is a proof of the incredible rapacity
with which the first invaders must have pillaged the property of the
Irish clergy, when they could not be restrained from plundering the,
property of a prelate of their own nation. “ For J ohn,” as Cambrensis
assures us, “ an Englishman by birth, a man of polished eloquenee, and
animated with a zeal for justice, was ordained cardinal-priest, and con-
secrated by Lucina, the Roman Pontiff⁰.”

But to return to my charge against Cambrensis,—that his eulogies of
those whom he loved or honored were as extravagant as his invectives
against his enemies were scathing and merciless; in a word, that parti-
sanship‚ not truth, was his guide‚ I give, in the first place, the torrent of
ribaldry he pours out against William Fitzadelm, who repressed the inso-
lence of Giraldus's favoritesd. He accuses Fitzadelm of avarice and fraud,

several instances of what he believed were favor.’‘-Hooker’s Translation„ Hib. Ex.
