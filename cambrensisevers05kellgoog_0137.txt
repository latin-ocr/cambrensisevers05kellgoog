graphy is s description of en extensive region, while topography may* ’

describe any place whatsoeven but melice, if he knpwingly abstained
from using the proper term, because he disdeined applying it to s
description of Ireland, and designed to throw her into the shade, by
classing . her -contemptuonsly among gei-dens, meadows‚ pei-ks or pre-
serves, or other places of confined dimensions⁸. But though the work
of Girsldus is styled a topography, it does not realize the idea and suh-
stance of either chorography or topography3 for if he be ignorant of
the rudimenta of geography, what fatal blunders must not such igno-
rance portend in the progress of his work Ρ The first rule of geogra-
phy is, “ to proqeed from West to North, and from North to South;
and this rule Ptolemy prescribed for himself as the best safeguerd
against error.” How is it possible, then, thet Gireldus should not hope-
lessly strsy in his trevels, when starting without any knowledge of the
right rond, he leid down no certain order of site or places ‘th-what good
can thet Topography bein which the most remarkable places os the
country described are. totally omittedb? Search Gireldus’ s Topogrephy

lonsly fond. But, in any case, his work is
more md less than what was ever under-
stood by a ‘⁴ Topography‚” and it certainly

does not realize his own notion: “My'

Topogrsphy describes the events and places
(loca) of past ages”--p. 7553 as far the

. greater part of the Topogrephy describes

what, he says, was existing in his own
nge. In that definition, however, he was
· making su antithesis between topography
and history3 andwheu s sounding snti-
thssiscenld be munded, common sense and
truth were with him generally secondary
δ The Topography consiste of three parts,
οι· “distinctim'' a term horrowed from
the scholastice: 1. siae, situation, soil, and
natural history of helsum 2. De Mirabi-
libns Hibernia, 1. e. its prodigies and won-
ἀοι-ε in the natural ami supernatans l order
compa-ed with those of other lands3 3. Its
first inhabitants and sucoessive colonies and

history. On the two first parts he obtained
no evidence or help from any Irish autho·
rity.-p. 693. His own word is the only
security he gives-3 bnt, for the third part,
he states his obligations to old Irish chro-
nicles. To comprehend the force of Dr.
Lynch's argument here, it may be useful
to know that the Topography extends to
fifty-four folio peges, of which fourteen are
devoted to the first part. Of these, three
only are on the εἰπε, boundaries, rivers, and
lakes of Ireland, while nearly eleven are
occupied with n mere catalogue of the birds
,and fishes, sc, accompsnied with discursive
moral end mysticsl reflections, in the fsshion
of the writm ,on natural history during
the middle ages. The second distinction
is twenty peges, of which fer the greater
part pai-ports ιο be s narrative of wonder.-
ιώ things, which ,Giraldus says he saw, or
heard wer-ein Irelsnd3 but his notices are
thrown' together without any order of time
