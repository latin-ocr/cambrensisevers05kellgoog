is his tripod now? Assuredly Apollo was unpropitious. Whatever

’ thought enters his mind, it is instantly seized to brand infamy on Ire-
land‚ never reflecting that it is not every timber that makes a Mercury, · Ι

nor every accusation a conviction. If Ι could trust my own opinion,
Ι would say that this unseasonable ‘parturition of the wolf is a. more
appropriate type of the cruelty of the Englishman coming to Ireland‚
and fgorging himself with blood, than of any rapine or treachery of the
Irish‚ who fought for their lives and their altars, their children and their
wiveS, against the robber allies of a traitor to his country. Treachery
and rapine can be charged more truly on the English than on the Irish.
For the English came as auxiliaries of Dermod Mac Murrough, who, ac·-
cording to Giraldus himself, “ oppressed his nhbles, exalted upstartS‚ was
a calamity to his countrymen‚ hated by the strangers3 and, in a word,
at war with the world„ Such was the man whom the English sup-
ported. They not only restored him to that throne which he had most
justly forfeited by his crimes, but, by a hideous injustice,·extended his
dominion by a large accession of territory, and rioted like savage furies
throughout boland, depopulating the'country‚ burning the public build-
ings, and plundering cities. Giraldus himself confesses those facts in
almost every page of his work, especially when he sayS, “that this new
and bloody conquest was defiled by an enormous effusion of blood, and
the slaughter of a Christian people.” Had the English confined their
cruelty to those whom Gir-aldus represents as their enemies, there might
be some palliatiom but, as if to secure their title to the infamy of the ρ
robber, they seized the propertyeven of the Irish who assisted them.
Giraldus himself exclaims τ “ The lands even of the Irish who stood
faithful to our cause from the first descent of Fitzstephen and the Earl,
you have, in violation of a treaty‚ made over to your friend8.” Who now
were those traitors and robberS, whose crimes were appropriately pre-
figured by wolves’ cubs coming to the world out of season’?

Let no person be displeased with me for venturing to dispute with
Giraldus on a subject in which he was a professe-d adept. Every one
admits that, in a matter merely of divination, different interpretatione
can be often given according to the wish of the interpretem. Thus
Cicero says, ‘⁶ that a racer‚ when preparing to go to the Olympic gameS‚
dreamed at night that he was travelling in a four-horse chariot: in the
morning he 'consulted a diviner. ‘ You must win,’ was the reply3 ‘ the
