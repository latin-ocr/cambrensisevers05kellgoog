Cmr. 111.]

Clogher‘. camden, himself, declares that in almost· every county in
Ireland there were many families os old Irish race occupying very con-
siderable properties. , ·

The Irish, therefore, not having been exterminated during so many
centuries after GiralduS‚ ,81111 1101 having embraced either English law,
language, or 11181111οτ0, until within 8 very late period, it was absurd to
entitle 8 book ‘⁴ The Conquest of Ireland ” in the life-time of Giraldus
himself. For Davis has very truly declared “ that the conquest of Ire-
181111 was made piece by pisce, by slow steps and degreeS‚ 81111 by several
attempts in several ages”.” Ι

But where was the necessity of this tedious and 011-0111130110 proof of
my position? Does not Giraldus himself decide in my favor, when he
deliberately 1108110 0110 of the chapters in his work “ The delay 81111 ob-

scarce ableto repair unto 110. When he was both sides in fair Irish character.”-Hist.
come we demanded of himasight of that an· Troas, p. 262. Sir John does not state

cient roll. The old man, seeming to be much
troubled with this demand, made answer
11181 110 11811 011011 8 roll in his keeping be-
fore the war, 11111 that it was burned, among
other of his papers and 1100110, by certain
English 001111οτ0. We were told by some
that were present that this was not true.
Thereupon my Lord chanceuor did minis·
ter 811 cath unto him, and gave him a very
serious charge to inform us truly what was
become of that roll. The poor old man,
fetching 8 deep sig-h, confessed that 110
knew where the roll was, but that it was
dearer to him than his life, and therefore
he would never deliver it out of his hands,
unless my Lord Chaucellor would take the
like oath that the roll should be restored to
him again. My Lord Chaucellor smilingly
gave him his word and his hand, that he
should have the⁴ roll redelivered to him if
110 would suffer us to take 8 view and 8
copy thereof. And thereupon the old bre-
hon 111011 1110 roll out of his bosom, where
he did continually bear it about him. It
was not very large, but it was written 011

whether the roll was returned, but he 0011-
fiscated the two ballibetughs which stip·
poi-ted the bards and brehons of M aguire,
“ because these persons merit no respect,
but rather discountenance from the State, for
they are enemies 10 1110 English govern-
ment.”—Ibid., p. 266. Sir John also 1108010
that, under his administration, “the clock of
the civil government was well set, and 811
1110 wheels thereof did move in order3 the
strings of this Irish harp, which the magian
trate doth finger, are all in tune,'’—i. 0.

-by the extension of English law to 811 1110

Irish‚ nominally, but, in reality, not to one-
tenth of them. The new system of exclu-
sion from equa-l English law was more ge-
neral and more oppressive than that which
it had supplanted. The mere Irish alone
were formerly excluded3 but the system
inaugurated by Sir John excluded not only
the mere Irish, but also the Anglo·1rish who

professed the old creed‚ and they were nine- '

tenths of Ireland. “ What is it that hath

been done Ῥ The same that shall 110 done? '’
“There is nothing new under the sun.’'
