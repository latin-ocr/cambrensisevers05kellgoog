nutely the most trifling circumstances- that, through sear of being too
concise, 116 preferred that his history should be condemned as too loqua-
cious, rather than as not sufficiently diligentde’.

How vain, then, was Giraldus’s boast, ‘⁶ that he was sending 1ο 1116
King a work which could not be lost, and which time could never
destroy,-a splendid monument of himself bequeathed to the world ;”

as if he would dispute the prize of vain-glorious boasting with Ovid
himself:

‘⁴ My work is done: which, not the wrath of Jove,
Nor fire, nor time, nor sueel can e'er destroy 3
When the dread doom, which o'er this mortal coil
Resides, my uncertain course on earth arrests‚

It is of little avail to him to adorn his work with pompous titles, to tell
us now “ that they are not trifling,” and next “ that they are excel-

a wish that. they were ‘⁶ translated into French‚” to have a wider circu·-

- applause from every source, no matter how contemptible. “ Giraldus,’²
he tells us, “ having acquired a great character, and a famous name, in
Ireland‚ resolved, as soon as he had completed and finished his work,
that his light should not be hidden under a bushel‚ but placed in a
candelabrum3 and accordingly he prepared to recite his work in Ox'ford‚
which, as being 111611 1116 grand resort and principal establishment of
the English clergy, would give him the most respectable audience. Th'e
recitation lasted for three days, one of the three distinctions of the book
being read each day. On the first day, he invited all the poor of the
whole town, and entertained them, and read. for them; on the second
day, all the doctors of the different facultieS, and the most distinguished
students3 and, on the third, the other scholars, the military of the town,
