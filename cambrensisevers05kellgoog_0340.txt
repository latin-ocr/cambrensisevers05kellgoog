J esu per Hiberniam plnres annos summa cum laude praefuit, nova ac·-
cessione ab ipso excogitata, non modice lyram ornavit: spatium enim
inter truncum et superiores lyroe partes patulum asserculis in cistulae
morem efformatis clausit et foramen in dextero cistoe latere positum
exiguo tantum ligneo clathro obstruxit, ut in clavichordiis videmus:
tum hinc et illinc duplici chordarum ordine collocate, lyram suavissimae

modulationi accommodatissimam fecit.

Porro cytharistae peritiores et

cultiores humeris lyrae cervicem cernui ut plurimum, nonnunquam
erecti admoventes, fila oenea extremis digitis, non unguibus pulsant

contubernio usus, illum intus et in cute

the Oountsss of Kildare, and received from
her a gift of 12,ooo livres Tournais, to
found a J esuit noviciate in Ireland. She
also bequeathed to him the castle of Kilkea,

¹Nc popular treatisq known to the Edi-

provement in the harp, noris there any

ment that forms the menpisco of-Bunt-
ing's volume, 1807. From inscriptions on

thatharp,itappears that itwasmadein
1621, for John M‘Edmond Fitzgerald of
clusin, that is, eloym, according to Bunt-
ing, but much more probably the Csstle oi'
Cluain, near Inistiogue, in the county of
Kilkenny, which castle was formerly the
propertyof a brana-h of the Fitzgeralds, one
ot *hom is to this day vivldly remembered
in popular tradition, ss a perfect master of
the harp. “By the pins, which romain
almost entire, Fitzgerald’s hal-p is found,”
says Mr. Eunting, “ to have contained in
the row forty-five stringe, besides seven
in the centro, probably fhr anison to the
othern, making in all fifty-two, and exceed·
ing the common Irish harp by mlv-two
strings.”--p. 27. These seven stringe for
unison mere, probably, the invention of
Father Nugent. His connexion with the
Fitzgeralds, and with the county of Kil-
kenny, make the supposition more probable.

of the family of Noah Dalway, Esq‚, of
Bellahil, near Garrigfergus, when Bunt-
ing's sketch was taken. ‘⁴ It contains‚” he
says, ‘⁴ twenty-fom- strlngs more than the
noted harp, (so) called Briau Boroimhe's,
and, in point of workmanship, is beyond
compa-ison superior to it, both for the ele-
gance of its crowded ornaments, and for
the general execution of those parts on
