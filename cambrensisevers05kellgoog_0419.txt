there was :not only no charge made against him, but he continued to the
last in high favor at Court, enjoyed to his death his office of royal cup-
bearer, was employed to bring about a peace with the King of Ireland‚
and endowed with ample lands in the county of Limerick, and great
power in Wexsord. I might a150, if necessary, urge in his defence that
our writers generally call him William the Conquerorss, for as William the
Bastard conquered England‚ so William Fitzadelm conquered Ireland,
where he had a numerous family, and was founder of the most noble
family of the Burkes. So generally did this family extend itself through
Ireland, that, in almost every district, they held extensive possessions,
and sometimes were the sole occupierS‚ while they also attained to the
highest titles of honor, and often to the supreme government of the

assailed with a torrent of abuse that bursts all boundS. ‘⁴ Depravity,”
he says, ‘⁴ had polluted him with various kinds of crimes. From his
earliest days he was a slave of impurity, and stopped at no incests or

than valorouS, more deceitful than distinguished, more talkative than
