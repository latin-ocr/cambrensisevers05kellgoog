to the Roman catholic raith. Some of our Proteetnnt gai-risone htely told the catholice
that nothing could stay these persecutione, save the abjuration of the Pope’a authority
and mass3 but vain was their labor, their labor now is vain. My countrymen, like the
Macchaboes, ure most constant in the tradition of their fathers and in fidelity to their
faith3 death they prefer to dishonor, firmly resolved, by the grace of God, that neither
the swerd, nor danger, nor persecution, nor life, nor death, eun separate them from the
love of God, which ιε in chmt Jeme our Lord.

“This fidelity it is which has lately excited the Protestantsz whole cat-goes of poor
catholice are shipped to Barbadoes and the islanda of Arum-lca, that thus those, whom
shame prevento from being murdered by the eword, may fall under the doom of perpetual

banishment. Sixty thousand, Ι think, have been already shipped off'3 the wives and ’

children of those who were banished in the beginning to Spain and Belgium are now

mre bound in (mains, undar-ried off to a'deeoiate island near the coest, where death by
eold and famine was inevitable. Abuudoned and penned up there, all were starved to
death except two, who ventui-ed to trust mmelves to the money of the ωας one of

told the tngic story of {ris associat& tate.

“’Sueh ιε the brief report Ι have to make to you, that you may prny to the Lord God
for us and for our country. Perhaps ,He may ›deign to look down on our miseriem but,
if not, Athe, suffering ip briefs-ffiss glory infinite—..a qalling to ‘manyr-ealvntion for q
fewr-retribution for all. Amen. ”
