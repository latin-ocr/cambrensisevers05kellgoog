cordS‚ of which he gives us the following account. ‘⁴ In the third part
alone‚’' he says, ‘⁶ there are, some sketches of the inhabitants of -the isle,
and the origin of the tribes, which Ι took from their chronicles„ But
as they were too diffuse and disorderly‚ and generally too frivolous and
redundant, and thrown together in a rude and indigested way, it cost
me a world of labor to select the more interesting parts, culling them
like pearls from sea sand, and arranging them 111 the most lucid and
- compendious form in my present volume? ” A moment ago he com-
plained of the paucity of Irish writers and the poverty of Irish chroni-
cles‚ whose vague and undefiled outlines had never been filled up until
his master-hand moulded and colored them into a living picture. But
now he complains that he is literally overwhelmed by the mass and va-
riety of Irish materials3 his great difficulty being to abridge “ their-dis·-
fuseness‚’' and lop away their ‘⁶ exuberant redundance.” The chroniclcs
were an Augean stable demanding the full exertion of his expurgating
powers3 but his success has not corresponded with his industry. For
his own work is strewn thick with the fetid refuse3 and, instead of
pruning down its rank luxuriance, he has put his sickle in the harvest
of ot-her men, and utterly destroyed the good seed with the weedS. The
whole frame of his work, in all its members, is a compound of ‘⁶ redun-
dant,” incolam-ent, contradictory statements‚ flagrantly opposed to factsg
and beyond a doubt it was he that destroyed the chronicles from which
he compiled: they must have been in Latin, as he was utterly ignorant
of the Irish languagee. ’
Justin wrote an abridgment of the vast work of Trogus Pompeius·-
Having pillaged the original of all that was most interesting, he is said
to have destroyed it, that his book might be thus forced into public'
notice, and rank with posterity among standard workS. Florus abridged
the flowing and copious narrative of Livy, and then endeavoured, it is
said, to destroy Livy’S, that he might thus rise to fame on the ruins of
his original. =These men were guilty of an atrocious crime, and in-
flicted an irreparable injury 011 the republic of letters; but they have
been too faithfully followed by GiralduS‚ wh0, under the'pretence of ex-
purgating the monuments of our fathers from fabulous narrativeS‚ and-
rescuing their-history from oblivion‚ has compressed them into so nar-.
row a compass that he mutilated the more solid and interesting portion,
and left them so meagre, that, sar from giving a history of our kings,
