bo lituo doubt that'they were cultio„ Annedoe Thierry has demonstrated the raet beyond
the possibility of cavil. It is admittedby all, that the Gauls, or Galatiam of Asia Minor,
were Celtas ς and St. Jemme attests that he heard them use the same language which he
had heard used by the nativos of Treves, confessedly the very centro of the Belgio popula·
tion. We may remark, too, that one of the arguments which determine the date of the
Septuagint version of the Scriptum, is the use of the word γαισος by the nausiators. It
is derived from the Gauiish (i. e. Galatian) word for spear, ‘⁶ gaes,” the word which gave its
name ιο the province of Leinster, and which, to this day, is preserved in the Irish language.

But it must be admitted that the Cauei, who figure on Ptolemy's map on the central
east coast of Ireland, were probably not a BelgIc people3 and it is highly probaffle, >from
their position in the rich plains of Meath and Dnblin, that they were comparatively a
modern colony. Now to account, if possible, for this admixture of raees on those lande,
which all our traditions regard as Eis-emunim, it may be useful to state briefly the revo-
lutions in Gaul, especially during the first century before Christ, because they appear to
confirm Tighearnach's date of Labhraidh Loingseach. Gaul, from the earliest ages, was
oemipied by Oelts, except the south, where Iberians‚ Ibero-Liguriam, and celto-Ligariana,
reigned trem the mouth of the Garonne nearly to the Alps. About 600 years before Christ,
the Gauiish Gelts were invaded by the Cymri, a kindred tribe, who introduced Druidism,
and cffected settlements, especially 111 the north and west. The mixed race arising from
theamalgamation of Celts and Cymri is called Gallo or celto-Cymaea About 350 years
before Christ, a second invasion of Cymri, who, for distinction's sake, are called cymi,
Belgae, reduced the two Ligurian- nations under the yoke. The oonquered territory was
nearly ‹io-extensive with the province of Langnedoc. The conquerors were called Volcae,
Ouoalki, Volgae, Bolgae‚ and divided into two branches, the Tectosagi and Arecomiki. Thus
we have in this southern province a mixed popnlation, Ligurians, Celts‚ Cymri, and lbe-
rians. It is highly probable-that an additional element was added during that memorable
invasion of the Cymri and Teutone, who combined their forces against Rome in the com-
m'encement of the first century before Christ. For, as soon as the Cymro-Teuton horde had
penetrated to the south os Gaul, the Tectosagi and Arecomiki ssew to arms with them against
the Roman province3 and though Marius defeated, and, it is said, annihilated their com-
bined armies, it is not an improbable supposition that some, and *among them the Teutone,
may have escaped and found refuge in th'e territories of-their friends in Languedoc. But
the argument foi-,the correctness of Tighearnach’s date is independent of that supposition.
For when Sertorius, who fought under Marius 111 the (Jymro-Teuton war, retii-ed ιο Spain
during the civil ware some twenty years later, and bade defiance to the power of Rome,
he was assisted by the Tectosagi and Arecomiki‚ who, after his-defeat by Pompey‚ becanie
the helpless victims of Roman tyranny and atrocious cruelty. All who were able, to save
themselves from the swerd, or famine, or slavery‚ fled to the Pyrenees, where, aided by
Spaniards and Iberians of Aquitaine, they defied for a considerable time the whole power
of Pompey. Compelled at length to yield, they-dispersed, or were transplanted ιο the
banks of the Garonne, about seventy-five years before Christ, where they gave its name
to the town “ Οοηνοωο,”·1ν111ο11 expresses their mixed origin. ‚113 then, we‘ admit the
authority of Tighearnach‚ and the tradition which brings Labhraidh Loingseach from Gaul,
