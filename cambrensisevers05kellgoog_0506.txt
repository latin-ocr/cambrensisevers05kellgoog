¹ For the existence of this chulrch, and
the story of St. Columba’s mass for Cor-
mac, there is no authority but Keating.
In the reseanches made by the Ordnance
Survey, it was found that tradition still
pointed out a small dumba or mound (re-

cently levelled) as thetomb of Cormac, at
Ros-na-Righe, near Slane, on the banks of
the Boyne3 but there was no trace or tra-

, dition of a church there. Colgan takes no

notice of such a church, though he was well
acquainted with Keating’s Histoi-y of Im·
land. Keating’s general character for fide·
lity must exculpate him from the charge of
forgery. He probably found the stor'y in
some modern romanoe, and, according to
his custom, gave it as he found it.

this tradition that he died a Christian, “ the
Druid,Breh0n, physician, poet, historian,an‹1

monarch's side, down to the arrival of St.
Patrick3” and this custom was perpetuated
in Christian times, the only difference being
that the bishop τοοκ· the place of the nmis,

restrict, if not totally reject, the assertion
of Niebuhr, vol. ii. chap. xi. ε “ The nobi·
