but that the unadulterated and national langnage of all other parts of
' Ireland‘was that Irish language which all of us, to this day, drink in on
our mothers’ breastS. Except the inhabitants of Dublin, 'Drogheda‚ .
and Wexford‚ and their immediate vicinities, the only knowledge we
have of English is what we learn in schools. Thus, as Quinctilian says,
‘⁶ he wished the pupil to commoneo with the Greek tongum, becauae the
Latin was so generally known, that whether one wished or not he could
not but· learn it‚” and as Livy also declares, ‘⁶ he knew, on the authority
of Romanwriters, that the boys were formerly instructed in Etruscan,
as they were in his days in Greek ;” so the first language we learn in
schools is a foreign language, because our own is so familiar to us. We·
all speak Irish‚ and many of ns can· read and write English3 but some·
persons, ⁴in their riper years, fascinated· by the sweetness of their‘ native
magne, turn to read and write Irish.

Some persons of the present day, who still cultivate their hereditary
branches of learning, have a profound· and critical knowledge of the
Irish tongue- For, as the art and practice of medicine was formerly
forbidden to all not descended from the family of AEscnlapins, and hence
professional physicians were invariably called, by the Greeks, ‘⁴ sons of
physieians,” so' history, jurisprudence poetry‚ and medicine, were, in
Ireland, cultivated by certain families devoted exelu sively to one par-
ticular branch. Thus those arts, instilled from their tenderest years,
and from the lips of a parent, were easily and deeply impressed on the
minds of the children, who cou‘ld not but make themselves perfect
masters of an art, of which they had learned the rudiments in their
cradle. But, like the GreekS, who, in accordance with their above-
mentioned custom‚ never called learned men, wisc, men, but philoso-
pher-s, that is, lovers of learning; how great soever the literary emi-
nence of any man in Ireland‚ he was never called learned, but ‘⁶ a son of
learning.” The· age, however, of a profound knowledge of the Irish “
language is, Ι sear, past for ever, since the hereditary revenues of its .
professione! masters have been taken away& Patronage is the life of q
arts, according to the proverb: and so Martial sings:

“ When patrous smile, the epic muse takes wing:
Flaccus! thy ,lauda would make a Virgil sing.”
