one half to angele, and the other ιο deviIS, which, he sayS, often ap-
peared there. He must either have paid no attention to, or misunder-
stood the train of, his informant's narrative. He describes the thing
itself most ²‚absurdlyz “ These speetres are never seen except by persons
shut up in the pits3 they never appear in other parts of the island.”
Had he wished ιο get his information from books, and not from hear-
say, he could have had full materiale from Heni-y of Saltery, who wrote,
about the year 1152, a clear= narrative of a pilgrimage made to that
Purgatory‚ by Owen, a knight‚ a short time before: ‘⁶ Our Lord J esus
Christ‚'’ he says, ‘⁴ appearing ιο St. Patrick‚ conducted him' to a desert
¹ place, and showed to him there one round pit, all dark inside.”b Here

thew Paris, which were published in the
Roman Breviary at Venice in 1522, were
expunged, ογ order of the Rope, in the next

edition ογ the same printer in 1524'. But '

it must be borne in mind that the account
of all the circumstances that led ιο the de-
struction of the Purgatory by the Pope

were not published before 1668 ογ the Bol-‘'

landists, six years later than the date of
Dr. Lynch's work, and probably were not
known ιο him or any of his predecessore
The notice in the Annals of Ulster merely
unsettled the belief regarding the situation
of the Purgatory, but did not declat-e there
was no such thing in Ireland. Certain it
is, however, that, in the sixteenth century,
the place frequented by pilgrims as St. Pa-
trick’s Purgatory, was in the island now
called station Island, of which an account
will be given in another note. The site
of the old Purgatory is marked on Saints'
lalana-omnam M‘bp.

δ Assuming0that Hem-y of Saltery’s ac-

count of St. Patrick's Purgatory was cor- -

rect and well known in Ireland when Gi—
raldus was writing, Dr. Lynch reasons well;
but there is no authority for St. Patrick's
visit ιο Lough Derg, though his biogra-
phers mark with great diligence his travels

and the charches founded by him. Lough
Derg is not chased among the wondera of
Ireland by the Irish Nomius, nor is it
marked in that sing-uhu 1310oe or topogra-
phy cited in Hardiman's Minstrelsy, vol. ii.
p. 381 ς and yet,0had it been a place osan-
cient celebrity‚ it could hardly have been
omitted, sven in Saltery's time' an irish
abbot, whom he interrogated on the sub·
ject, said he had never heard of the Purga-
tory. This latter significant fact is omitted
in Messingham, p. 108, οἰιι is given inCol-
gan's Trica Thaum„ p. 280. If, then, an
Irish abbot had been totally ignorant of the
existence of this purgatory, Garamam&
be aequitted of malicious intent in not
agreeing in all the particulars of Saltery’s
account. The whole story rests on the au-
thority of an Irish soldier, Owen, who, after
serving in the army of King stophen, re-.
turned ιο his native country, went to con· ι
fession to the bishop of the place in which
Lough Dei-g is situated‚ was admitted into '

the cave of -the Purgatory ογ the monks„ ἱ

and there, not in spirit· or ecstasy, or ογ
vision, but corporally, went through purga-
tory, and saw hell and the terrestial para-
dise3 told his adventures, on his return to
England, ιο Gilbert, a monk of Louth in
