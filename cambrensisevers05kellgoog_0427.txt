flagrant offences against truth. What Ι have written already convicta
him not only of having indulged persona-l prejudices, and pandered igno-
miniously to the will of others, but also of having shamelessly embla«
zoned his own panngries, in defianoe of this rule laid down for the
composition of a history, that the historiari should forget himself, and
not only make no parade of his talents or learning, but avoid even 1110
slightest suspicion of ostentation. It degi-ades the dignity of history,
when any design appears either of aequiring celebrity or favor, 01· of
indulging an excessivo love of our own, or hatred of a foreign country,
or of parading our learning. Cicero has observed, with equal truth and
eleganoe, that even 1110 history of Rome herself has adopted too much
of the funeral orations and panegyrica on her great families⁰; what then
must we think of the innumerable errore of Giraldus, who never cheeked
his pen in the whole course of his work, when enemies were to be abused,
or friends panegyrized ? especially when a historian is bound, under pain
of depreciating his credit, never to exceed the strict limits of truth in
praising the princes or great men of his own party, or censuring their
antagonists. When a man betrays favor or hatred towards any party,
there is no hope of getting truth unadulterated. To command our un-
hesitating assent, the historian must prove himself superior to passion
and prej udice: the proverb says truly‚ ‘⁶ that the discernment of reason
disappears whenever the subject interests the passione„

Cupidity or sear, flattery, party-spirit or hatred, should neverguide our
pen. Let the truth be stated plainly, without any false shades or coloring.
Foris a person write the truth without disguise or dissemffling, he will
suppress nothing through passion or party-spirit3 say nothing through
hatred; write nothing from cupidity or avarice, to fiatter or to pleasc.
It is unJust, and contrary to a sacred law of history, to gloss over or
suppress the faults of our friend8‚ and emblazon their good deeds, while
the noble actions of our 0110111108 are suppl-essed, and their crimes made
the theme of virulent invective. To act thus, is not to write history,
but to plead your own cause against an enemy; you are not an histo-
rian, but an orator, whose great maxim is never to say anything that
may damage his own cause. There are but too many examples of
writerS, whose histories are rather labored panegyrica than narratives
of facts. Kings and princes, and their great merite, are the burden of
the page; they are compared and preferred to the most renowned Empe-
