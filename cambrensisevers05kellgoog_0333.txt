the contrary, says: “ The harper uses no plectrum, but scratches the
chorda with his crooked milev, and never marks the flow of his pieees
to musical rhythm‚ nor the accent and quantity of the notesr, so that,
on the refined ears of an adept, it comes almost as offensively as the
grating of a saw.’' ffhis, however, is levelled against the bad harper,
but not against the harp itself, for he immediately adds: “ Crusius, a
contemporary of our own, is far the most eminent harper within, the
memory of man. He is entirely opposed to that barbarous din which
others elicit from their discordant and badly strung harpe. Such is the
order of his measures, the elegant combination ofx his notes, and his
observance of musical harmony, that his airs atrike like a spell on the
ears of his audience, and force you to exclaim‚ not that he is the most
perfect merely, bnt in truth almost the only harper. Hence it is
manifest, that hitherto it was not the harp that was wanting to the
performers, but performers to the harp.” But there never was a time
when Ireland could boast of only one distinguished harper. Many emi-
nent performers might have flourished in Stanihurst’s own time‘, in
parts of Ireland where he never travelled. We certainly have the

ι Galilei, writing about the middle of the
sixteenth century, thus describes this ps-
culiarity of the Iriah harpen-s: “ The musi-

stanihurst, in the passage cited, is describ-
ing an ordinary convivial meeting, attended

whose performance could not bs taken as a
fair specimen of the national music, espe-

cially as the Irish hat-pers were a profea-
sion, unlike those in wales, where, in the
days of Giraldus, every family had its self·
