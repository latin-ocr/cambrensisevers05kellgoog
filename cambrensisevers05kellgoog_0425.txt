of all animal's, he answered truly, “ the peasants’ tyr-ant, and the flatterer
of his friendss’ Flatterers are expelled from the palaces of Kings; so
Girsldus’s name must be expunged from the roll of historiens. Preju-
dice and w‘him, not the interests of truth, were the guiding star of his
narrative. .

In his account of the atrocious cruelties perpetrated against the
inhabitants of waterford, Giraldus gives an astounding proof of his
great hatred of Hervy, wh0‚ he maintaina committed those crimes “in
despite of the remonstrance„ of Raymond. But Maurice Regan, the inter·-
preter and servant of King Dermod‚ had a good opportunity of hearing
and even witnessing those scenos, as he was then living with his master
in Leinster‚ on, the borders of which province the massacre was com-
mitted'· Now, in his ‘⁴ History of the Μαίη of 1re1and in his own
Time,” Began distinctly asserts, that Raymond had excited his followers
to the massacre, in order to avenge the death of De Buoein, one os his
friendffl. Giraldus has, therefore, been guilty of a flagitious lie, to shield
the 'fair name of his cousin from the black stain of infamy. Another
falsehood is what he tells os the victims being ·thrown down from the
rocks, whereas Regan states merely that they were slain. Giraldus added
the other circumstance, in order to fix on Hervy a still inore savage
taint of barbarity. His whole history, therefore, being one tissue of
lies, what credit or respect is it entssled to? Put out the eyes of a living
creature, and the remainder is useless3 follow a history without truth‚
and every step is an error. For truth is the foundation, the strength,
the life, the soul of history, without which it is a monster without
shape or grace, “ without truth,” in Giraldus's own, words, “ no history
can have any authority, nor desei-ve the name even of a history: even
on the most trifling points great care should be taken not to tell even
the slightest falsehood.” Cicero was perfectly right: ‘⁴ The first law of
history is not to dare to state anything false3 that the writer be free
alike from prepossession and· prejudice: these are principles which
every one knows.”
