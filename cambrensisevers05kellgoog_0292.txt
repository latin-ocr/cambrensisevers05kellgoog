¹ Now Toher. He was seated in the ba·-
rony of fflonlisk, adj0ining O'Banain on the

. north.

¹⁸ Called O'Hegane in o'carrou’s Sub·
mission. This family-is now called anylice
Egon, batthename is tobedistinguiahed
from Mac Egan of Ui-Maine and Lower
Ormond. The Editor knows families of both
. names, O’Hegan and Mae ngan, who afe'of
a totally different raee, but still write the
name alike‚ Egan, without any prefix. These
summes cannot δέ distinguished when tuq
Irish language oea-ses to be spoken.

¹ Now Fogarty‚ without the O'. The se·
nior braneh of this family is now extinot,
and their estate of Castle Fogarty devolved
to the family of. Lanigan, who descend from
them in the female line. . .

¹⁰ That is, Eile-Ui-Fhogartaigh, i. e.
O’Fogarty’s Ely, now‘the barony of Elio-
garty, in the eounty of ‘lipparam O'h-
Uidhrin states that O'Fogartaigh is of the
raee of Eochaidh Bailldearg [King οἱ Tho-

mend, who was baptized by St. Patriek} ‘

and, if this be true, he was not of the
same tribe with O’Carroll, who was of the
,race of Tadhg‚ son of Cian, son of Olioll
Olum. , ’

¹· This is a blunder of Dr. Lyneh's.

⁰·Now O’Keeffe, a family of the raoe of
Cathal mae Finguine, King of Munster‚
and King of Ireland for a time, who died
in 742. They were seated originally in
Gleaun-Amhnach in Feara-Maighe-Feine,
and more recently in Pobal-Ui-Chaoimh
⁸ [Pobb1e·0’Keeffe]‚ in the north-west of

the barony of Duhallow‚ in the oounty of
Cork. There is still a respectable repre—
sentative of this name in Ireland3 but the
chief of the family emigrated to ··Franee
aster the revolution of 1688, where his de·
soendants bore the rank of count. One of
them, Colonel O'Keeffe, still living, distin-

guished himself in the reoent war in Al- ·

geria.

q Now anqlice O’Suflivan, and frequently
Sullivan withoutthe prefix O’. There are
many respectable families of this name still
in Munster, but their pedigrees have not
been published or weced. Timothy O‘sul-
livan, Esq.‚ of Prospeet‚.near Remum, in
the county of Kerry, is the senior legiti-
mate representative in Ireland, of the line

of O’Suffivm More: Sircharles summ os ·

Thames Ditton‚ eounty of surrey, whose
pedigree is given in Barke’s Peerege, is
traced by Mr. Burke to O’Sullivan More.
The head of the family of O’Suuivan Beate
emigrated to Spain 3 but many of the junior
branchos are still respectable in the origi-
nal territory, as Rmothy O’Sullivan, Esq.‚
of Rhinodonegan ; william O'Sullivan, Esq.‚
of Omickanees; but their pedigreee have
not been published or traced by any of our
geneal‹›gists. The Count O’Sullivan de =
Graes and the Baton O'Sullivan de Ter-
deek, represent respectively branehes of the⁸
O'Sullivan More and O’Sullivan Beate, who
