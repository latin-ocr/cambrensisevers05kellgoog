this god. What is this but evoking from hell superstitious long since
anathematizcd by the Church, when a Christian, nay, a theologian of no
ordinary stamp, but one well versed in the higher branches of that
study, attributes a virtue to certain dayS, and actually embraces the
opinion of the unenlightened pagane, wh0, under ,the belief that the
fatet controlled the destiny of men, maintained that the ‘⁴ nefasti dies”
were unfavorabla the ‘⁶ fasti,” favorable for commencing any enterprise.
It is astonishing how any Catholic could attribute a virtue to the fateS,
as if their decrees were the pivots on which the event of human affairs
revolved, and as if all the designa of man, and the vicissitudes of this
world, rollcd on in that course marked out by them, and not by the
providence of God. Then might the decisions of theologians give place
to the tenets of pagens, who lay down that

‘⁴ We’re ruled by fate 3-adore its power:
No anxious cares can change
The stem swerd-..the destined honr:

All moi-tal deeds, οι· suffefings here,
The fates above arrange.”

A still more striking proof of his apostacy to paganism is his mode
of invoking the divine assistance. No other form could please him,
but ‘⁴ May the gods give me savor¹;” and, not content with this homage
to false gods, he appears before us as the patron of magicians, whose
tricks he recommends to the belief and veneration of men, with the
whole weight of his authority; thus, for example, when he tells us of
a certain moving island, which sometimes disappeared altogether from
human view, but which was fixed firmly, and became visible and acces·
sible to man, when fire was thrown upon it, he closes his narrative

‘ thus: ‘⁶ there are a thousand arguments to prove that fire has ever been

the most mortal enemy to all sorts of phantoms⁸.”
To exhibit his universal and profound acquaintance with every shade

of superstition, he gives an elaborate recommendation of divination, and, ·’

existere inter diabolica ludibria sive phan- tiones eorum qui philtris, amuletis, notis
tasmata et ignitum ferrum sive ignem quem- magicis aut aliis ex pacto tacito vel ex-
vis esse arbitratur. Nec advertis Ο Theo· presso cum Daemone inito habitis, se nullis
loge! quam latam pandis portam volentibus telis, ignibus aut violentia hostili loedi posse
antipathia simili velare sacrilegas supersti- persuadent sibi.’'—Apoloyia‚ c. vi.
