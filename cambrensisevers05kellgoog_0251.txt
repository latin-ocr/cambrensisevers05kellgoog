O’Byrnes petitioned Henry VIII. also, about the same period, that their
country might be formed into 011 English county‚ with th'e style and
title of Wicklow county2. But these anxious wishes of the Irish⁸ were
blasted by the persevering hostility of the Anglerish herous, who
persuaded the King ‘⁴ that it was unwise to communicate the laws of
England to the Irish3 11101 11 was the best polioy to hold them as aliens
and enemies, and to prosecute them with a continual warh. ”

Perhaps some person may suggest that the object of these loide, in
dissuading conciliatory measures, ww, to have a permanent battle field
for the exercise of their military virtue, and keep away the rust and
bluntness from their swordS. They sared, perhaps, that idleness might
make them effeminate, and a long cessation of war unfit them fo'r the
field3 like Scipio Nasica, who voted against the destruction of Carthage,
lest the Roman youth, after its fall, might lose that incitement to mili-
tary virtue which a rival city would inspire. We may be referred also
10 1110 exhortation addressed to the Israelites in Scripture3· “ that their
sous should learn to light, and to aecustom themselves to battle.” But
motives of this kind had not the slightest influenee on those Irish lords.

Sels-interoet, the advancement of their own sordid views‚‘ were the real a

motives of the advice they gave to the King. They were afraid that if
the Irish were received into the King’s protection, and made- liege-men
and free subjecte, and placed 011 the same footing as the English of Ire· .
land⁰‚ the laws of England w'ould establish them in their possessione hy

butes, was more profitable to the iord than
‘ English law. He considered himself 111-
vested with 0111110 rights of the dispossessed

when 1000111100οᾶοᾱ by the authority of the
ο erown. The motives of this poliey are
‚variously accounted for. Some are stated

by Dr. Lynch 10 1110 words of Davis, who,
together with all the English writers of his
day, was as severe 00 1110 Anglo-Irish aris-
tocracy as other English writers have been
on the Irish aristocrscy created by. Eliza-
beth, «100100, Cromwell, and Wiuiam ΙΙΙ.
⁶ A valuable note to Grace’s Annals, p. 54,
assigna some of the principal motives on
which the Anglo-Irish lurda resistkd the ex-
tension of English law to the natives. The
Brehon law, with its crios, and bonaghts,
’ and annidies, and 011011οτ1030, 0οᾱ other tri-

Irish 0111οΜ11, 0οᾱ sometimes obtained 0
confirmation ofthat right by royal charbem

that is, the King author-izeei him to govern “

the Irish by Irish law. A passage of an
,old writer (cited 10. 1110 Tn‘beae and Cae-
tome osHy-Many‚ p. 139), is peculim-ly
valuable, 11000000 11 describes the condition

01· the tributary 111011, when English power ,

was 10 1110 ascendant, before Bruce’s inva-
sion. During that war, O'Msdden had been
