in one province had been already adopted throughout Ireland by Henry
Sidney and preceding governors, who swept away in one heap every-
thing that they could lay hands on; so that one of their most special
188118811088, when deputed to govern this island, would appear to have
been, to annihilate, with the most unsparing hand, every monument of
antiquity in Ireland.”

It 18 8 fact well authenticated by the testimony of the last genera-
tion, that, while Ireland was wasted by the flames of war, the Queen’ s
troops, &herever they were quartered through the country, rifled the
11011888 of friends and foes indiscriminately‚ and carried off all Irish
manuscripts„ This Vandalism must, probably, have been the execution
of a government order, for when the soldiers were called in to gari-ison
the towns, large leaves of those manuscript volumes were distributed
to schoolboys to make covers for their books, or 881 up in the tailor's
shop'to make measures for clothes. This exploit of English soldiers
against Irish manuscripts in modern times was, no doubt, a part of the
hereditary tactics, imported and transmitted by the first English inva-

himself in this destructff‘on of our (1088818818, “ when he omits the
881888, 8811088, 8811 11188 of the Kings of Ireland, because he found in
them little remarkable or worthy of notice, and because useless prolixity
would encumber his abridgment? ” His envy or ambition surpassed
even that of Floru5‚ J 118118, and Polydore3 they published the line of
kings, he suppresses them3 they gave a history of their reignS, he is
not-only silent on that point, but brands them with contempt. These
injurieS, 1 think, will be somewhat repaired by a list of Irish kings
contained in my work, giving, together with their names, many of their
noble achievementS, as an answer to Giraldus’s malignant and jealous lie,
and proving that their noble actions were not only ‘⁶ worthy of notice,”

But during the reign of Elizabeth‚ as stated
by our author, the same system was adopted
in Ireland, which 8118, 88 well as her imme-
diate predecessore, had adopted in Wales.
There the Bible, when translated into W’elsh
by the natives, was taken from the churches
