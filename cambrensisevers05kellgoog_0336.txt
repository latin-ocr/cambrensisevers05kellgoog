marked in the oldest specimens given by
Bunting, as in the compositions of later
ages. Many of our airs, perhaps, lose their
genuine character by the lang-uid and drawl-
ing manner in which they are frequently per-
formed. At the meeting of harpers, which
took place at Belfast in 1792, Mr. Bunting,
who was appointed to note down the tunes,
“ was surprised to find that all the melodice
played by the hai-pers assumed quite a new
character,—-spirited, lively, energetic, —cer-

tedicus manner in which they were, and

too often still are, played among faition-
able public performers, in whose efforts at
realizing a false conception of sentiment

by which they accommodate themselves to
the feelings of the performer, becoming at
will either sad or solemn, or merely tender,
without much injirry to the essentia] struc-
ture of the melody. Melancholy can hardly
be said to be the characteristic of our music
