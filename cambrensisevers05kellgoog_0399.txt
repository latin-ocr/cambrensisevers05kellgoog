and not mean vanity, They recited their works to their friends, in order
to correct defects. Thus Horace says: ‘⁶ 1 never recite except to friends.”
Augustus als0, according to Suetonius, “ recited some of his writings to
private parties of his friends.’' “I make use of every means of correc-
tion,'’ says Pliny, “for, in the first place, Ι revise carefully what I have
written, then I read it for two or three, next I submit it to others for
annotatione, and, if a doubt remain, I again consult with a friend or
two on those notes3 finally, I recite it before a large pa‘rty.” ‘⁴ Private
recitatione of this kind,” as Theophrastus remark& ‘⁶ produce solid cor-
rections ;” and the same is true of public recitatione, if used to elicit
the criticisms of the auditory, as Pliny said of Silius, “ that he some-
times ascertained the criticisms of other men by recitations.” ovid, ”
also, recited his juvenile essays in poetry before the people. Vanity
was, however, the object of many recitations. Persons were even hired,
or ‚promised a supper, to praise a composition3 and at the delivery of
certain passageS, they were sure to exclaim‚ in chorae, “ profound,”
“beautiful,” “good,” “right‚” “excellent,” “charming,” “most hap-
pyP’ Hence, such critics were styled by Martial, ‘⁶ sophos‘,” and board-

eulogists: ‚
‘⁶ Repeated bravoes hail thy works divin03

Silius applaude thee, for he loves thy wine !”

Giraldus, therefore, hired >a gorgeous but insensate “ sophos,” by pre-
paring, at enormous eost, a supper for so immense a multitude, not that
he might impart any additional excellence to his book by the criticisms
of the auditory, but solely to win popular applause by his grand dis-

play, and give amusement to the people. We may address him in the
words of Martial:

“ When flattering crowds these acclamations raise,
Not thee, Cambrensis, but thy board they praise.”

The custom of recitation, which, according to Giraldus, ‘⁴ was not known
at any time or age in England,’' was not unusual in Ireland‚ Thus
Dermod Mac Car‘rollss, King of Ireland‚ sitting with Flann Feapla Mac
Scanlanf, and other princes, at the Feis of Tara, listened with pleasure

715, and was not contemporary with the trie’s Antiquities of Tar-‘a Hm, pp. 105,
monarch Dian-maid, as erroneously stated in 1063 and Harris’s edition of Ware’s Bi-
the preface to the Dinnsenchus.-See Pe- shnps, p. 40.
