⁸ There is no clue known to the Editor
on the meaning of these surnames. The
last probably refers to sun-worship3 but
that was part of 'the national creed. The
plough may represent the god of agricultu-
ral industry3 and Coll, the worship of the
hazle or nut-tree. For the worship of trees,
see Miscell. osIrislt Arch. Soc. vol. i. p. 123
also, note, insi-d, 'on Cormae Mac Art.

⁸ However uncertain may be the history
of this colony-of the' Tuatha de Daumius,
there ean be no doubt of th'e high plaoe
they held in the national traditions as a
race of superior civilization. Thus the Irish
version οἱ Nennius, Irish Art-lc. Soc. p. 47 z
‘¹‘ It was of them were the chief men of
sciense, as Luehtenus, artifex3 Cmdenus,
figulusg Dianas, medicus3 alsosEadon, the
nurse of the poets3 Goibnen‚ Faber3 Lug,
son of Eithne, with whom were all the arts ς·
Ogma, the brother of the king. It was from·
him came the ,letters of the Scots.’' The
similarity of the last name to the Ogmius of
the Gauls is strikIng. According to Ame-

dee Thierry, Hister-ie den Gaulois, vol. ii.
pp. 60, 70, vol. i. p. 33, third edition, the
religious system, of which Ogmius was one
of the gods, was introduced into Gaul be-
tween the years 638 and 587 before Christ.

· Its power was broken in the same country

about 200 years before Christ (ibid. vol. ii.
p. 100), and the Druids, its great priests,
were then driven to the British Isles. where
there is no decisivo historica} evidence to
the contrary, we should incline to believe
that the Tuatha de Dananns were an off—,
shoot of this second Celtic race iu Gaul.
But while so many of the old Irlsh recorda
on the primitive colonists of Ireland re·
main unpublished, it would be premature
to*venture any opinion, especially when
those who have given ‘⁴ dissertations” have
hitherto been so unsuceessful. The best
step yet taken towards the elucidation of
the history of Pagan Ireland was the pub-
lication of the original pieces in the Irisla
Nes-nius, with the explanatory notes, and
collation of οιΙιει-*Ιι-ἱεὶι documeuts.
