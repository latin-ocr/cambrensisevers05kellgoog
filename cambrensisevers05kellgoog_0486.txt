Unus Fiacho filius matris utero tum inclusae, supererat quoe Ethnea.
Imghile dicta, regis Albaniae filia praegnans in Albaniam concessit, ubi
Tuathalium Techtmarium peperit, qui regia institutione ibi excultus,
ubi adolevit, Hiberniae regnum ubi postea vendicavit.

Elimius Conrachi filius in Regio solio collocatuS‚ illud viginti annos
insedit, infausto interim regni tempore usus: quas enim Athachtuachis
poenaS, ob extirpatam et exterminatam nobilitatem Deus inflixit, easdem
de Elimio et Athachtuachis ob Fiachum nefarii confossum, sumpsit.
Nam toto tempore quo Elimius imperavit nec terra frugeS, nec arbores

Tuathalius Techtmarius regni habenas exinde capessivit. Oui quia
tellus Hibernica illo regnante, pristinae restituta faecunditati foetus
quosque abunde fuderat, agnomen ‘⁶ Techtmar,²’ quod “ fertile’' signi-

Ireland in small bodies, and, mingling· with ’

the other rme, would naturally lose their
distinctive nam03 but in Ulster, where they
retained to a late period the large tract Dal-
araidhe, in Down, and in Antrim, we find,
so late as the days of Adamana, that Dala-
raidian and Cruithne were synonymous.—-

also records the death of their Pictish king,
(luchiacum, A. D. 708. — Ward, Vita S.

notice of the Cruithne by that name, though
'some of the rece¹ were afterwards kings of

and Conuor, p. 353. Hypothesis, Iknow,
has been the bane of Irish history3 that

which is here proposed is certainly open to

strong obJections, but not so strong as the
difficulty which it is intended to solve,
namely‚ the position of the Irian territories
in the, earliest ages, the positive assertion
that many'of the Irians were Picta, and
that a colony of Picts ‘⁴ had preceded Eire-
mon in Ireland,” and “ gained great power
there.” Should it be objected that our 1¹5-
pothesis is opposed both to secular and ha-
giological genealogies, the render must re-
member that Spenser claimed the O’Byrnae,
the Ma'c Swineys, Mac Mahons, ἃο. stc„
