certainly calls himVicar Apostolic os Killala‚ a title, however, which
does ‘not imply that he was bishop‚ but the contrary, for, in the
Catholic Church in Ireland, the vicar apostolic was only a priest.
Dr. Nicholson mentions Dr. Lynch twice in the body of his work,
once as a ‘⁴ secular priest,” and again] as ‘⁶ Archdeacon of Tuam ;”
in the preface only it is asserted that 116 was subsequently appointed
Bishop of Killala. The authority of Dr. Burke is entitled to re-
spect. Dr. Nicholson might easily have c‘onfounded our author
with other Lynches, It is certain that Dr. Lynch was not bishop
or vicar apostolic in 1665, the date of O'Flaherty’s letter to him
on Irish chronology3 nor in 1669, when the Life of Kirwan was
published, the title-page styling him merely Archdeacon of Tuam.
Itis also certain that he died in France3 so that, if he ever became
vicar apostolic or bishop‚ it must have been in the seventieth year
of his age. Now it 'is highly improbable that, in times so diffi-
, cult, an old and infirm man, who had resolved not to return to
Ireland, would be selected for the charge of a diocese3 and it is
more improbable that Dr. Lynch‚ if he accepted, would remain in
Fiance, for 116 had strict notions of the obligations of chief pastors
to encounter all hazards in the discharge of their duty. A con-
clusive argument may be founded on the fact, that, when a
Spanish Dominican visited Galway in 1674, to inquire into the
pedigree and' family of the LyncheS, Dr. Lynch’s name does not
appear as vicar apostolic or bishop‚ but as the late Archdeacon of
Tuam; though, were it in the power of the Lynches to adorn the
catalogue of their episcopal connexions by his name, they would
not have omit-ted it, the precise object of the inquisition being to

ascertain the respectability of their family in the Catholic Church. .

Had he been bishop or vicar apostolic, would Peter Walsh cite
him repeatedly, in the History of the Remonst'rance, as Father
John Lynch‚ and in the preface to the Prospect of Ireland‚ written
in 1682, describe his rank as ‘⁶ sacerdotal,” the object of t-he pas-
sage being to magnify all Dr. Lynch's claims to respect? More-
over, from Dr. Renehan's comprehensive manuscript History of the
