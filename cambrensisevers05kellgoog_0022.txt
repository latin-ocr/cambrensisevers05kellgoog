Irish C‘atholic Bishops after the Reformation, it appears that John
Babtist de Burgo was Vicar Apostolic of Killala at 1116 very time
during which alone Dr. Lynch could have been vicar apostolic.
The usual style of an Archdeacon,‘ ‘Reverendus admodum? is pre-
fixed to Dr. Lynch’ s epitaph, preserved 111 3 copy of his translation
of Keating, transcribed by F ather John Donnelly‚ Ο. S. D. ,-Dro
gheda‚ 1712, and now in the possession of Mr. O' Donov an.

From the manner in which Dr. Lynch's name 16 introduced
into the inquisition held at Galway, 116 was probably dead 111
1674. 111 1116 poem, written seven years before, he declares that,
as he was even then tottering on the verge of the grave, it would
not be worth his trouble to go 60 far as Ireland for a little clay to
cover him. From the following epitaph, composed by his friend
and fellow —,laborer O' Flaherty‚ it would appear that he (116(1,
where his works were published, at St. Malo’:s

He outlived nearly all his distinguished literary contempora-
ries, and, with a few brilliant exceptione, they have had, in their
own order, no successors. Like 1116 unfinished cathedrale of those
ages to which they devoted their geniuS, 111611· works remain the
admira? ..1011 and the reproach of posterity. ‘

This volume 16 printed correctly from 1116 original, no change
being made, except in the incorporation of the addenda with the
body of the work, in those places where, from inadvertence or
other 6311666, they had been omitted 111 1116 original. Itis also
hoped that, in the present edition, the number of errata is at least
considerably diminished. The old paging· is retained 111 our mar·
gin, for facility of reference, as 1116 original 16 60 exceedingly rare.
