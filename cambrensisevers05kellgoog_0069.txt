DEDICATION. . 45

· miserable Iri-sh who were wandering outcasts on the sace of the earth.
And, like him, you have proclaimed an etei-nal oblivion of all past
crimes, ‘⁶ for it is nobler to conquer injuries by kindness‚ than to deal
out-on them an obdurate revenge.” ’
Parents always specially avoid showing to one of their child ren such
marked kindness as to excite the envy of the rest. As you have been
a most indulgent parent to ue, we have no apprehension that you will
confer more favors on 'the late settlers in Ireland than on the old An·
glo-Irish. The law of God himself declares: “ that if you have respect
to perenm, you commit sin, being reproved by the law as transgressore ;”
and the laws of man require “ that every man shall have his right.”
The ancestors of the old Anglo-Irish laid the foundations of English
power in Ireland by their swords, and consolidated it afterwards by
- their blood shed prosusely m never· ceasing warfare during several cen-
turies; and the inhabitants themselves lately exer-ted all their powers·
of body and soul and resources to maintain that sovereign power invio-
„ lable in their King. Fortune did not smile on their exertions, it is
‚true3 but it is the attempt, 1101 its issue, that must be taken into ac-
count. For “no one would say, that the turn of events is the stan·
· dard by which the merit of man’s actions must be estimated.’' Those
late settlers turned their rebel arms against the Irish, not 10 uphold
but to sub'vert his Majesty’ s throne in Ireland. The 111111νο8, there-
fore, are both by character and hereditary principle inclined to be loyal
to the king3 1110 00111013, 011 the 011101· hand‚a1·e impelled by the evil
bias os their education, and =their own obstinacy, to oppose him. .1f;
then, nothing be more (1111101111 than a change of temper, or the sudden

eradication of any deeply-rooted moral habit, is it creditable that these .-

men should be restored to your Majesty's favor, while we are excluded ἲ
01· that the ever-faithful natives should be ej ebted from their own and

their forefathers’ propertieS, to make room for those perfidious for· ·
eigners? as if that h'erd were

‘⁴ An born of favorite sires,
And we a ποι-1111000 and unlucky brood.”

We hailed with no ordinary joy the tardy conversion of those settlers, ἡ
'whom ,hidding adieu to rebellion‚ they laid their power at your feetf.
