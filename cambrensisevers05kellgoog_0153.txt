With regard to these wells I make this general remark, that neither
now, nor at any former period, have any traces been discovered of foun-
tains with such properties 3 and, if the properties were natural, time
alone would not destroy them: moreover‚ his vague mode of pointing
out the site of those wells is in itself a strong ground for suspecting
a falsehood. You would be tired going over all Munster and Ulster
and Connaught, before you get any account of them‘. The truth ie,
Giraldus must have greedily and foolishly gathered up the silly stories
of persons anxious to worm themselves into his favor. For my own .
part, Ι incline to Keating's opinion, that heaven permitted such prodi-
gies to be committed to Paper, that Gerald’s mendacity should be more
notorious; or, perhaps I should add, that his obj ect in heaping together
so many sables may have been to intimate tacitly to the world, that
the whole history of Ireland was of the same fabulous character. But
why has he omitted the miraculous wells of Leinster and Meath? He
lived a long time in those provinces, but never saw· or set his soot in
Hister, Connaught‚ or the more remote districts of Munster. In Meath ‘
and Leinster there are many wells which the saints formerly drew from
the rock or from the hard earth, at which miracles are worked even to
this day, many persons recovering their sight or the use of their umbe,
or their reason, or getting a cure of various other diseases⁸. “ In Meath‚'’

Giraldus improved the legend by the in·
vention of the peculiar rites for appeasing
the well, of which see more, p. 136, n.·¹.
But he can hardly be acen-sed of drawing
exclusively on his imagination‚ because it
manifestly appears, from the accounts of
the mirabilia collected by Dr. Todd, that
various editions of the same stories were
afloat in‘ ancient times: Aecording to Mr.
O’Donovam it is still a popular notion in
in Ireland, that a spring wau, if deffled,
would dry up or emigrato to some other
locality.

· 1n the Lim of the Saints, fountsssiins
similar to those described in the text are fre-
quently mentioned. — See the Bollandistaee,
June 29, pp. 433, 336, ror the wellin the

Mamertine Prison, and those on the spot
where St. Paul was beheaded‚ all of which
have been associated in tradition with the

memory of the Apostles. In Ireland, the ‘

number of wells is very great. Martiniere‚
in¹ his Geographical Dictionary, describes
them as a characteristic of Ireland: “ Il y
a partout des sources et des fontaines, non
seulement sur les montagnes et les rochem,
mais aussi dans les plaines d‘ou elles coulent
sans bruit et presque sans aucun bouillonne-
ment.” “ There are a great number& other
fountains throughout all the land, called
holy wells by the inhabitants, whose waters,
not differ-Ing from that of other wells in
smell, taste, or any other 'sensible quality,
nevertheless are believed to be effectual for
