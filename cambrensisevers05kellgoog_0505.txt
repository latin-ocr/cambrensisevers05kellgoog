One hundred and fifty dishes of gold end silver, studded with gems,

But his justice and equity

to all were not inferior to his hospitality to his guests, so that the. great
and most bountiful God illumined his soul with the light of Christian

faith' seven years before his desthu.

The Druids were so incensed

against him for his conversim, that they wrought his death by magic
spells', in the thirtieth year of his truly royal and glorious reign,

A. D. 266, 'A. M. 5465¹.”

“ Several centuries Ister,” adds Kenffing, “ St. Columba, walking
one day to Rosnarighr, on the banks of the Boyne‚ the place which
hed been celebrated as the sepulchre of Cormac, found, by chance, that
monarch's skull, bnt committed it to th'e earth with due ceremonies,
and did not depart without offering up the sacrifice of the mass, with
the intention of drawing down the mercy of Grod on the departed.” ,

spent in seclusion and retirement, because,
having lost one of his eyes, he was eom-

meh, who recorda the blinding of normae,
describes him *as defeating the Desii four
times aster that accident, and benishing·
them to Μηδία-ιμ’. 469, n. 8, cupre). The
tradition of his' belief in the true God is
very ancient and general. Bnt when we
reflect that the Celts of Gaul, had some
centul-ies before the Christian ers, revolted
against the Druids, and almost destmyed·
their tempor-al power, perhaps Cormsc’s
hostility to the Irish Druids was, in the
lapse of ages, interpreted ss a proof of his
Christian belief. In a very ancient manu-
script he is described as saying, ‘⁴ that he
would not adore stenes or trees, but Him
who made them.” It is in his reign that the

first shadowy outlines of an Irish monarche,
that is, of the whole island, appear. -
