Ferrara, m one of his epistles.”

A knowledge of many languages‚ so far from being an incumbrance
or discredit, has ever been prized 88 doeirable and useful. It 18 not the
least among the glories of Mithridates, King of PontuS, that he under-
stood the languages of the twenty-two nations which owned his sway,
and was able to converse with their delegates without the aid of an
interpreter. The Romans themselves did not think the Phoenician lan-
gange*¹ beneath their notice, ‘finding that it could boast of ²some works
of no inconsiderable merit. A knowledge of many foreign languages
was never despised by the ancients3 it has been at all times a laudable
study. Wisdom of the highest order has rewarded the labors of those
men who travelled through many foreign countrieS, and were able 10
converse with their inhabitants in the native language. Homer's eulogy
of Ulyssae is summed up in the words:

“The towns and Iaws of many lands he knew.”

Travellers‚ by resigning for a time the domestic hearth and the
sweet society of friends, and snrveying the wonderful things of various
natione, soften down the asperities of their native character, and ap-
ply to native rudeness the corrective of foreign civilization. By the
same means they acquire a familiar knowledge of the language of those
countries through which they have travelled. The bad habits, if any,
which they contract in their travels‚ must be attributed to their own
depravity, not to the languages. For 88 1118 1188 extracts honey‚ a'nd the
spider poison, from a flower, so 1118 knowledge of a language may pro-
duce good or evil, according to the character of the linguist. In this
world there is no good which may not be abused, Does the knowledge
of 8 foreign language make a man a traitor to his country? Are the
Welsh rebels to the King of England‚ because they speak Welsh? Are
the Bretons in France‚ and the Can tabrians of the Basque Provinces in
Spain, rebellious subjecte, because they do not use the language of their
respective kings? And if Irish be the common language of the Irish‚
are they to be charged with compassing or contriving the murder of.
