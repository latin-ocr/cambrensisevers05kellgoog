interesting than the remaining chapters of the work. 'I'hroughout
the whole work, he proves himself superior to the fatal animosities

· and prejudices which had so long divided the two great branchos

of the Irish family. Taught, perhap8, by bitter experience, and
beholding the Irish‚ old and new, involved m indiscriminatc ruin,
pining at home under the soldiers of Cromwell, or begging rtheir
bread abroad from foreigners‚ who must have despised them for

the Remonstrance of Domhnall O’Neill, in the fourteenth century,
but urging accusations far more momentous There could be no
peace, it declared, until the ‘Anglo-Irish had been corrected or
expelled. ⁹ They had supported heresy under· Elizabeth‚ and
by their half-measures in the late war had ruined Ireland. Dr.

ι Lynch stood forward as the apologist of his racc. In an exceed-

ingly rare and valuable book, he reviews Anglo-Irish history, in-
