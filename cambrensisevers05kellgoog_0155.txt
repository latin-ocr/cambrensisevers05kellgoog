David Rothe, Bishop of Ossory, suysz “ there is a well of St. John the
Baptist²‚ and in Leinster a well of St. Brigidu. St. Moling’s well, about
four miles from Rom, near the River Nore, was formerly a celebrated
place of devotion sor all orders in public prayer against the plague.”
John clin relates in his Annals that, in the year 1348, “‘Bishops and
prelatas, monks and clerice, nobles and othere, and immense crowds of .
every age and sex, went on a pilgrimage to cross the stream of Tath-
moling‚ and in such crowds and multitudes that many thousand persons
were for many days assembled theree’*

well is stm a favor-ite resort for pilgrimus on
, two fair days, the lvth of June und ,aab
ofJuly. The well pmpoelyuo canedisa
-round basin of water, about two feet deep,
overshsdowed by old nah neec. From the
busin the waters guzh out, through two
square orifices cut in grauitas, into another
receptaele, formed by hugo brocha of the
sam· sume. It lies about ἱ100 ytrds north·
east of the nounstm. 'rho pilgrims com·-
mence their munds or station: at the well,
and conclude them at a ruined cell near the
great church, beside which is a ruined cross
of ancient date. A rapid mountain stream,
which fiows between the well and the mo-
nastey, is oeoflsed by the puga-im· in their
ronnds, apd that &mammon is probably
expressed by the word ‘⁴ vadafio ” in (nyn’s
account. The scenery around the well is
striking3 the Barrow, on one side, flowing
at the foot of Brandon hill, and, on the other,
the Carlow mountains rising between Car-5

low andwexford. There insurgeres«

clynis referred to the sume year, 1348, in
Graoe’s Annds, p. 1433 but to 1349 ‘by

mins commenced on the 24th of June, con-

&c- &c- Devotions at St. Mullin’s well are
not now regarded as a special protection
against the plague3 but, on the patron
days, young children are carried from ull
the sumunding country, and immersed in
the water. Why the pilgrims ford the
stream at st. Mulnn’s, the Editor cannot
demmin& bnt, in similar pilgrimages,
such as st st. John’s well, four miles from
Killoenny, and St. Kieran’s well, near Kells,

‘praying in the cold water is considered as

part of the austerity of the penaunce—12

matum which, like other peculim-ly Irish

customs, can ,be traced buck to the earliest
ages os the Irish Ohurch. See, for instance,
Colgun, March 11, on Amyn-s, author of

basilicas, fountains were constructed‚ or,
if water could not be had, cisterns. Pope
