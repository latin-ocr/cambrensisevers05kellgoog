Roderie sueceeded, and died after a reign of one year.

Gand and Genann reigned jointly four years·

Sengann was slain in the fifth year of his reign, by Fiaehaeh, the
“ Cenfionnan.”

Fiaehaeh, the “ Cenfionnan,” son of the above-named Roderie, was ,
slain after a reign os five years, by Rionnal. Fiachaeh derived his sur-
name of “ Cenfionnain” from the fact that, when he was king, the

inhabitants of Ireland were white-haired.
Rionnal succeeded and reigned six yearst, he was slain in the battle

of Eabhehorbress, by Foidhbgen.

Foidhbgen, after a reign of four yeme, was slain by Eoehaid‚ in

the battle of Muirtheinhneh.

Eoehaid reigned ten years. During that period there fell no rain on
the land of Ireland, no moisture but dew; yet the land yielded its

fraite.

Then also were injuries repressed‚ and laws first established.

He lost his kingdom and his life in a battle against the Tuatha de

Danannsi at· MoytureJ'.

Nine kings of the Firbolg raee sat on the Irish throne during a ,
space of thirty-seven yearsk. · The seeptre then passed¹ to the Tuatha
de Danaam, wh0‚ aster partly extirpating or banishing to various
quarters the rival Firbolgs, gave the title and style of king to their

leader Breuem, principally because, by the maternal line, he was de-
scende-d from a most renowned ancestry.

Β The number of years allowed to the
Firbolgs is the same as in Keating and the
Four Masters; but O’Flaherty extends their
reign to eighty years— Oyyy. p. 173. That
such a tribe preceded the Soots is proved
from passages in our ancient laws, which
regulata the tribute to be paid hy the ‘⁴ daer
elann,” or enelaved tribes-*See Book of
azyma, p. 174, also omia, p. 175, for
the districts where the F ifbolgs were set-
tled long after the Milesian invasion ς also

¹Thpugh Irish authorities do not agree

on the number of years during which the
subcessive colonias governed Ireland‚ they
are unanimous on th⁰e order in which they
arrived: Firbolgs3 then Tuatha de Da-
nanns3 next, the Milesiam 03 Seots. “ Orn-
nes nostri annales, omnia fragmenta me-
trica, etsi in annorum supputatione dissen-
tiant, in re tamen ipsa, in numero, ordine, et
nominibus coloniarum conveniunt, nec ulla
vetus auctoritas adversatur.”--O’Conor,
Ptoleyom. pars ii. p. xlii.

don), who is said to have invented a kind
of Ogham alphabet, which was found on
his person, after he had fallen iube battle
