rous and expressive words, in pointed and exquisite diction, and is, in
fine, connected with the Hebrew language by a common bond of affl·-
nity⁸.'' The witticism, the jest, and the epigram, it expresses briefly3
and, in the hands of the poet, it is so pliant and flexible, that the U rai·
conche* lays down rules for more than a hundred different kinds of metre3
so that, in the opinion of men who are well acquainted with several
languageS, Irish poetry does not yield, either in variety, construction, or
polish of its metres, to the poctry of any nation in Europe. Spenser
himself corroborates this opinion, when he says: “ I have caused divers*
of Irish poems to be translated unto me, that I might' understand them,
and surely they savored of sweet wit and good inventiom they were
sprinkled with some pretty flowers of natural device, which gave ,good
grane and comeliness unto them.”

Stanihurst, however, strains every nerve to depreciate its merits, and
declares it to be so excessively difficult, that no stranger can ever ξο-

elegant a language as the French hsd not
adopted it 3 and declares that in no lan-
guage was it so common as in the English
and Welsh. Now this proves either that
he never saw Irish poetry, or that he wil-
fully robbed it of an ornament which he
prized so highly asto make it the charac-
teristic of his own Latin style. Alliteration‚
under the sti-ictest rules and conditione, has
been, at all times, an essential ingl-edient of
Irish poetry.--See the Book osRt’y'hts, and
the Archaeologieal books. We content our-
selves here with one quatrain, which is un-
questionably very ancient. It is a prophecy,
attributed by the biographers of St. Patrick,
in the sixth or seventh century, to the
Druids of Laeghaire‚ foretelling the coming
of our Apostle:

“Cncpm collicen'o cup mum mem-
G ἓξὲξ-3 comneno, α cpont> opom-
ceno,
(1 vinat- α η-αηιῦὴθῃ α ωδε,
, Fuit-ceput: α ῐίιιιιηεθῃ uh, omen,
omen.”

“A Taillceann (artis caput) shall come
across the stormy sea,
With his head-piereed hood, his crooked-
headed staff,
His altar shall bein the cast ofhis house,
· And all his people shall answer, amen,
amen.''
