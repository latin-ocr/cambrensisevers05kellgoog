‘⁶ And describes his native country, the land of his fathers, in the most
glowing colors3 but in the second he describes things as they really are.
For whether for salubrity of climate, or charms of scenery, or fertility
of soil, or the other purposes of human life, there are many places in
Wales superior to Demetia.” The same Powell, who, I have no doubt,
was intimately acquainted with Giraldus’s writings‚ as he has written
commentaries on some of them, pronounces‚ aster a full investigation of
Giraldus’s character, “ that his usual custom was to attend solely to
the object he had in view, to the utter neglect or forgetfulness of other
matters on which he wrote ;” that is, in other words, according to
Powell, that Giraldus’s object was not truth, but the indulgence of
whatever passion was uppermost at the moment.

There was, therefore, much sense in the remark of John, Abbot of
St. Alban’s, that Giraldus was sparing ‘⁶ of his worda, but lavish of his
opinions,” if, as Stanihurst supposes the meaning of these words be,
‘⁴ that Giraldus put no restraint on his pen whenever an enemy was to
be lacerated.’' Such was Stanihurst’s own opinion3 for he sayS‚ “that
Girsldus spoke favorably of his friends, but lacerated his enemy without
mercy.” stanihurst had diligently studied Giraldus's writings‚ and was,
of course, best qualified to form a correct opinion of his character. But
what a low estimate this critic formed‘* of the ‘⁴ Topography,” appears
from the fact, that of the one hundred and fifty-eight chapter-s in the
three divisione of that work, he published only thirty-one, purposely
suppressing the rest, as utterly unworthy of being presented· to the
public& He also clearly proves that, even of the published chapters,
not one'was unexceptionable. But the “ Conquest of Ireland” he
held in such contempt, that he left it in its old obscurity‚ and merely
selected whatever was to the point, omitting the rest as rank verbiage‚
