igitur est Galliam Hibernorum (qui soli tum Scoti dicebantur) multi-
tudine tunc abundasse, quando eorum aliquot manipuli per silvas ex-
currentes tam inhumanis et efferis grassationibus licentia militari
fraena impune laxarunt. Nec enim Christianismus inhumanitate illos
adhuc exuerat. Hibernos autem solos ea tempestate Scotos fuisse vel
locus e cambrensi paulo ante productus cumulate convincit. Etenim
Sanctum Hieronimum anno aetatis octogesimo secundo mortuum, ado-
lescentiae annos egressum fuisse, nello sub annum Christi 379, reg-—
num ineunte oportuit. Nello autem imperante fundamenta Scoticae
gent-is in Britannia jacta sunt. Hieronimo igitur adolescente, Scoti
solius Hiberniae ineolae fuerunt. Nec obest quod gens Britannica
Hiberni vocentur, quia in Britannicarum insularum numerum a scrip-
toribus priscis, et recentibu3‚ Hibernia relata est.

¹ But it is doubtful whether the greater morasses and foresta, in a state of utter bar-

part of those Scots may not have been auxi-
liaries taken into the pay of the Romans.
The barbarian auxiliaries, when disbanded
or disappointed of their pay, osten inflicted
in those terrible times frightful ravages on
the helpless provinces which they had been
enrolled to protect.

8 The Christian religion had been em-
braced, very probably, by many in Ireland,
more than a century before this period.
Nor is that fact by any means irreconcila-
ble with the imputed cannibalism of some
of the Pagan Irish3 for even, in the six-
teenth century, some of the native hish,
acknowledging no subJection either to na-
tive chiefs or English rulers, lived in their

bai-ism. The most marked cona-asts, in
the social state of different classes of Irish-
men, occur in almost every page of our his-
tory to the present day. It is evident‚ at
all events, that Dr. Lynch, as well as other
historiam, was utterly ignorant of that
glorious Christian Church which, accord·
ing to Sir William Bothum, preceded St. Pa-
trIck in Ireland, and was corrupted and de·
stroyed by him—Antiqwrian Researches.
