Lord Lieutenant of Ireland‚ afterwards, in the reign of Elizabeth,
formed Annaly, the country of the O’Farrells0 in Leinster, into an Eng-
lish eounty‚ which he called Longford. Davis ascribes? to the same
Ι governor the establishment of the Connaught eounties. But in this he

is opposed by the authority of the author of the ‘⁶ Life'and Deeds of
Sir John Perrott,” who admits that Sydney m'ay have had such an in·
tention⁹; but asserta that the six counties, Clare‘, Galway, Mayo, Slig0,
Roscommon, and Leitrim, were formed by Perrott in the year 15860.
He also attributes to Peri-ott the institution of seven Ulster coun-
ties: Armagh⁹ Monaghan, Tyrone, Colernine, Donegal, Fermanagh, and
Cavan. But camden, Ι find, includes in Ulster two other enunties,
Down and Anti-im‘. It is, however, beyond a doubt, that English law

In 1258 one orthem forms atGael-uisge, on
Imgh Eme, a national league with O'Conor ,
and O'Nem against the English. In 1260
Fitzgerald invades Thomond, but is de-
feated. In 1261 one of the O'Briens aaeks
Castleeonnell. In 1269, in conjunctioni with
O’Conor, they gave a bloody defeat to the
English at Cart-ick-on-Shannon. In 1270
they destroyed the English caatls of Clare,
but, in 1273, were subdued by Fitzgerald,
and compelled to give hostages. In 1277
the O'Brien was treacheronsly alain by
De Clare 3 but, in 1278, the invader'p foroea
‘were eut off, and himself taken prisoner.—
Maon, vol. iii. p. 34. 'mese facts enable
the oeader ιο judge of the assertion of Ba-
ron Finglss. Few English settled in Clare
before Cromwell’s time,

⁸ Dr. Lynch omits the fact that, before
the Parliament of Kilkenny, A. D. 1296,
Gonnaught had been divided into two eonn-
ties, namely, Connaught and Roseommon,
the latter, it is thought, lying north, the
fonnet- south, of an undefined line from the

about 1286, when an Earl of Ulstertook the
hostages of all Connaught. But a ghnee
at the Fom· Masters (pp. 447, 45¹7) shows
what sort of obedience ιο English law pre-
vailed in the interim. It would be easy
to prove that the authority of au English
