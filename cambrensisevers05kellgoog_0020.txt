officiated for ten yearS‚ transferred to another worship: finally,
his writings had given offence to the father of some person then
in power; and, though many of the nobles vz·ere0inolined to pro-
tect him, the son might sacrifice him to the ,vengeanee of the
father. This dreaded personage was probably the Grovernor of
Galway, a son of Sir Charles Coote3 for Dr. Lyneh denouneed, in
no measured termS, t-he sanguinary deeds of Sir Charles and of
his accompliees. From the chronological notiees of his own
labors in the exordium of the poem, one might conclude, at first
sight, that it was intended for publication (though it was only
addressed to a friend); but when we remember that he studiously
abstains from all allusion to himself in his published workS, and
published nearly all of them anonymously, we must rather regard
the letter as the sineere apology of a noble-hearted and sensitive
priest‚ for not encountering in his old age the perils of the Irish
mission, on the grounds that he had labored there during thirty
years of his prime, and, moi-eover, that he had leisure in a foreign
land to devote the remainder of his days to the literature of his

country.

In 1669 he published the life of his uncle, Francis Kirwan,
Bishop of Killalad. In his other works we see the scholar, pa-

whose care himself had been educated, and wh0, in every phase
of his eventful life, in perseeution as in prosperity, as a bishop and
as a priest, had labored to prove him-self worthy of his vocation,
and to supply the manifold wants of his Chureh. Itis one of the
very few biographieal memoirs extant in Irish Catholio ecole-
siastical literature. --

Most modern writers state, on the authority of Dr. Burke and
D1·.Nieholson‚ that our author was Bishop of Killala. Dr. Burke
