who was going to run, told an interpreter that he dreamed he was
changed into an eagle: ‘ Victory is your’s,’ he was told3 ‘ no bird flies

which have as little connexion with truth as his opinions had with true
religion, when he erred so sar as to say, that Tuesday was a fortunate
day, because it took its name from Mars, the God of War. “ It is
