were our follow-citizens, and ure said to be concocting every day sta-
tutes and enactments, not for the public good, but for destruction.
Verres was accused by Cicero of a most grievous offence, for having,
on the death of a Senator, substituted (for a bribe) a colonist for a
native, contr-ary to a, law, which mooted, that the number of nativos
should exceed by one that os colonists in the Senate os Agrigentum end
Heraclea. Onr Parliament has sar surpassed the guilt of Verres, for it
consists of colonists, to the utter exclusion of the natives, and almost Ι
of the denizens. As osten as the Irish Parliament assembled during
the last century, so often did the natives protest against soreiguers
sitting in the Senate, and the complaint was invariably received and
instantly redressed. We therefore indulge the confident hope, that,
as you sar surpass your predecessors in clemency, you will check the
progress of this fatal aggression, and interpose to avert the plague that
hangs over ue, nor tolerate the shameful violation of ancient custom,
which 'it is always better to maintain than to destroy. Such was the
” opinion of Ennius:'
‘⁴ Her ancient customs nerve the arm of Rome.”

Would not the English fly to arms at once, if Irishmen alone delibe-

rated and voted in the English Parliament, and confiscated English
property, and made it their own ? A writer of their own religion would

tell them, that a King forfeits his crown, when, “ having many nations .

under his sceptre, he shall, for the interests of one people‚ sacrifice
another, to- plant colonies in their room.” The men wh0‚ for slighter
canses, raised their banner against the King'‚ and consummated his
ruin, would appeel to the sword as the only honorable security against
so frightful an injustice; they would not aweit, as we have done, the
awai-d of the Soveneign. ἢ It was galling enough that foreigners should
sit in judgment on our lives and properties in the English Parliament‚
bnt it is far more dreadful to be depending on the mercy of foreigners
inthe heart of Ireland‚ since the former were judges in the cause os
othere, but the latter-are judges in their own. N 0 mortal can ever
be a judge in his own cause, without feeling a greater interest for his
own side than for his opponents. We should have some reason to be

1641, and denounced au the proceedings mationa! rebellion of the Irish Papists'’
os the confederata Catholics‚ “ as almost a against the King. *Bm-lasa, p. 381.
