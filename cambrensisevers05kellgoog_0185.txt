The geographica] position of a country, also, is of great moment in
deciding on the origin of its inhabitants, “ It is more reasonable to
suppose,” says Camden, ‘⁶ that a country would be peopled from neigh-
bouring than from very remote places.” Now since Caesar writes “ that
there is an island called Mona, lying off the central part of Britainssf and
Cambrensis describes it as ‘⁶ stretching midway between the northern
parts of Ireland and of Britain‚’' the position of the country is as favo-
rable to colonization from Ireland as from Britain', and diminishes in
no degree the force of the arguments founded on the similarity of the
language and customs of Man to those of Ireland.

J ocelin, it is true, declares that when St. Patrick dispensed the
light of saith to Man, ‘⁶ Eubonia, or Mennis, was then subject to Bri-
tain.'’ But that statement appears palpably contrary to fact. It is
repugnant to common sense that the Irish‚ who at that time carried
the war against the Britons into the beart of Britain, would leave the
enemy in quiet possession of an island so well adapted, from its posi-
tion, for a descent on the Irish shores. And could' the Britons be such
fools as to endeavour to hold a distant island, while the desolating swerd
of the enemy was within their territories, and dismembering large por-
tions of their dominions? J ocelin’s authority and honesty are not
beyond suspicion on this matter. There are cogent reasons sor dis-
trusting him. He had asserted falsely that the Irish were instructed

by the English in ecclesiastical rites‚ an assumption for which he has
been chastised severely by Peter Lombard‚ Archbishop of Armagh'.

but suddenly a light springs from Ulidia,
spreads over the island, and brings back
the splenio? οε the primitive days. ‚Jona-

of Turgesins, and the tyranny of the Danes3
the returning light as the labors of St. Ma-
lnehy3 and the crowning gloryas the coming
of the English. But Lombard objects to
this interpretation, on the ground that the
English, as he had already proved, so far
stom developing religion and civilization in

the country, had, on the contrary, increased
the miseries of the native IrIsh, fomented
their discord‚ deuied them the uss of arms
and the establishment of universities, final-
ly persecuted, in his own day, the religion
of St. Malaehy. Dr. Lynch, though a de·-
scendant ot* the Anglo-Norman invaders,
had all the feelings of the old Irish3 and he
maintaina in another place, that Henry 11.‚
a murderer, blasphemer, adulterer, and sa*
crilegious tyrant, could not feel a sineere
interest in promoting the spiritual happi-
ness of Ireland. Hence his severity on Jo-
celin.
