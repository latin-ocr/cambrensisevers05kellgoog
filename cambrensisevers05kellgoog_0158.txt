tiana before the introduction of chrnfianity
into Ireland. St. John chrysostom (Hom-19.

celebrated at the angry well, or of the bar-
barous ceremonias related by him. In Ire-
land‚ as in all other countries, there sprung
up from time to time obstari-aneas which
are now condemned as barban-ons and su·-
