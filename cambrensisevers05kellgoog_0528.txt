(Holidays Edit. p. 193, now, capra, p. 434), tthly, that the best soldiers of the great Eire-
moniau, cormac mac Art, and ot his father and son, were Firbolg (Damno-um of Royal
Iride Acoeten-y, vol. i. p. 543 oquia, pp. 328, 841), and that he found a retreat from his
enemies among the Connaught Belga (p. 47 7, upra), 5thly, that the Firbolg Gaznanra·
dii are expressly styled ‘⁶ the great Milesians” (Hy-Fidckrach, p. 291) ; finally, that the
ooldiers of the three collas, who destroyed the palace of Eamania, and conquered the
greater part of Irian meter, were all Belgae—Supra, p. 491. These may be only coin-
cidences in the history of the traditionary Firbolgs of Slainghe, with the historic inva-
sion of hbhraidh Iningseach 3 but they are coincidences sufficiently strong to justify great
doubts of the former, especially as Dr. O’Conor (notwithstanding note θ, which 1 have
takent'rom him, p. 417, supro) admits, in another place, that some of the bestanthorities
do not mention the first colony of F irbolgs. Momover, nothing is more common in merely
traditional history than an inversion of dates and events. When the conquering Belgae
and the conquered had been amalgamated into one people, and began aftersome centnfies
to digest their history, it would not be unprecedented in hai-dic story to find them ante·
(lating, by some thousand years, the Firbolg invasion,an event which occurred shortly hefore
the commencement of the Christian era, and adopting as their own the genealogy of ano·
ther race settled with them in Ireland. Thus, because the Romans, who conqueret!
Britain, were descended from AEneas, the Britons soon discovered that their own ancestor,
Britus‚ belonged to the same family—Irim Numine, p. 85. And when, about the middle
of the fourteenth century, nearly all the rui-al Strongbownians had adopted Irish names
and dress, they found no difficulty in tracing theb· origin toMilesian, or to any stock but
the English, though the continued presence of English power in Ireland, and the constant
influx ot· English blood, must have counteracted powerfully the process of amalgamation,
and the general adoption of Milesian notions. 1 think it manifest from Irish history, that,
it new English colonies had not been planted in-this country in the sixteenth and seven-
teenth centuries, the term “ 8830ηῇ or‘ ‘Englishmanffl or‘ ‘’'Normam would have been
long since, even in the baronia-l halla of Butlers‚ Barkes, and Fitzgeralds, as opprobrioua
an epithet as‘ ‘Firbolg” ever was in the ancient rat-hs and cathairs of the so-called Eire-
monian nobles. But there are two other means of explaining how Eirbolg and Eiremo·
niati, though really the same race, might yet have been distinguished z—flmt, by admitting
that at different intervals, from A. C. 300 cin, colonies of Belgae may have lauded in Ire-
land from Britain οι· Gaul, but that they were subdued by the great Belgio colony in the
year A. O. 83, 69; οι· by what appears to me a more probable supposition, that the Belgae
of Leath Cuinn, that is, the race of Crimt-han, A. D. 79, gradually extended their conquesta
over their kindred in Connaught and in Leinster, during the course of the three follow·
ing centur-ies, and that thus the conquered Belgae of Iaeinster and Connaught came to be
regarded as mere Firbolgs, while the conquerors were metamorphosed into Eiremonians.
But however these matters may be explained, no advocate of the antiquity of the Eire-
monian colony can explain how it happened that Tighearnach could not find a regular
succession of Eiremonian kings before the Christian era, though he gave a list of Irians
from the foundation of Eumenia, A. O. 305, mee-Supra, p. 445.

Though Mr. Moore adopts the opinion that the Belgae were a Teutonic race, there can
