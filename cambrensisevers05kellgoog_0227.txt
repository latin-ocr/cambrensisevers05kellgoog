The truth is, there were no means in those times of enforeing the ,
English laws in the administration of justice, because the provinces had
not as yet been reduced into the regular and defined forms of English
enunties, The first example of the institution of an English county
was in the year 1556¹‚ the third of Philip and Μαι-γ, when Lord Thomas
Sussex, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, reduced Leixm and Offaly¹², the coun—
tries of the O’Mores and O’Conors, into English shire0ground, calling

and north-east, by the English of Meath,
from Durrow Castis, and by the Birming-
hams of Carbury. His demesnes must in-
deed have been eoniiued to the den-ies of
the Bog of Allen, and the tract around Kil-
leigh and Tullamore? There was an Eng-
lish castle at Geashim yet the O’Conors
were not contemptible even when English
power was strongest. In 1284 they bui-ned
the castle of Ley3 and, in 1294 they burned
the rolls and tallies of the county [of Kil-
dare ?]. In 1305, the King and his brother

of Birmingham in Carbury3 but, in 1307,

Not so in Leix.
