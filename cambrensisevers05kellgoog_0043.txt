“ Cato alone was,” ιο Cicero, ‘⁶ as one hundred thousand.’' The Israel· ⁰

ites cried out ιο David, “ thou alone art accounted for ten thousand;'’
for after slaying Goliath alone, he was said to have slain ten thousand.
AEmilius-Probus says, that Epaminondas alone was worth more than the
whole city of Thebes. And Antigonus looked upon Zeno as one hun-
dred thousand. Moreover, the laws of natione, the laws of God and
man, have ever enacted, that guilty Kings shall not be subject to the
tribunals of other men0.

“ Dmd Kings of right their subjects'must obey,
O'er Kingn thamselves Jove only holds the sway.”

Augustus, and afterwards Vespasium, on their accession to the impe·
· rial throne, were declared by the Senate superior ιο the laws3 and Aris·-
totle denies that they who are bound by laws are truly Kings. David,
addressing the Lord, said, “ ιο Thee alone have 1 sinned;’' “for he
was a King,” says St. J emme, “and feared no other man;” or, ss St.
Ambrose remarks, “ Kings are free from the punishment of crimes. nor

· can any law subject them to penalties, as they are shielded by their

superior power.’' David, therefore, did not sin against man, to whom
he was not subject z ‘⁶ for Kings‚” as the proverb goes, ‘⁶ do not tie up
their own hands.” ,

The confederate Irish, in conformity with these principles, spon-
taneously professed their sworn allegiance to your father’, and flew to
arms, not, like the English, ιο depose, but ιο support him. But
now, the intemperate remonstrances of these English would persuade
your Majesty ιο reward their perfidy, and ιο punish our loyalty: a
paradox that was never heard of. They ask you ιο

“Par-don the ravens, persecute the dovesss’
But“ men are always inclined ιο pardon everything ιο themselves, and
