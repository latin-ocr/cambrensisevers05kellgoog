O'Shea or O'Shee, and O’Failbhe is made
0²Fa1vy, and both are also very frequently
written without the prefix 0’. Corna-
Dhuibhne is the present barony of Cerca-
guiny, and Ui·R.athach (dat. plur. Uibh·
Rathach) is the barony 'of Iveragh, In the
south-west of the oonnty of Kerry. Dr.
Lynoh has here „omitted the family of
O’conghafl, now anylino? O’Connell and
Gonness, which had been seated sor centn—
ries in Iveragh, as hereditary constables
of the eastle of Ballyoarbery, under Mac
Carthy-More.·—See Book of Riylm, p. 47,

mentioned by O‘h-Uidhrin, and it would
appear from other authorities that O'Cear-

*which afterwards belonged to the family of

O’Donnehadha.

place here. The Corca-oiehe, of whom

in the present barony of Lower Connell03
