of the conquest of Ireland ;’' so that both works were probably giventn
the public in or near the latter year⁸. The virulent calumnies leveued
against the Irish, in these productione, drew down some censureon the
author immediately after their publication, as himself bitterly com-
plainsb. But, after his death, the workS, being only in manuscript, lay
mouldering 111 obscurity‚ the food of moths and wormS, and were not
in circulatim, until, in an evil hour, they were published by Camden,
in the Frankfort prees, in the year 1602. ,
Thus Lombard‚ who wrote shortly before that year, says: “ This
Topography (of Cambrensis) is not yet printed. ’' Father Stephen
White⁶‚ a Jesuit, doctor of divinity, and professor emeritus, compiled a
very elaborate dissertation, which vindicates triumphantly the fame of
Ireland against the slanders of GiralduS. A small fragment of that work
is now in my possession3 and from it we may as surely infer the excel· ‚
leuce of the rest, as we know the lion by his claw3 but, unfortunately,
I lent the work its‘elf some time ago to a person, and it has now passed

non ignobile nostum· Topographiam livor
laniat et detrectav’- Presnce te the Con-

his work and his defence.

lost, hus been 1⁸0er discoveaed by S. H.
Bindon, esq„ Secr. Celt- Soc„ in the Biblio-

is entitled “Apologia pro Hibernia adversus

which see ΜΓ. Bindon’s valuable ⁸¹> Notices

rused by many persons, and pronounced
not only worthy of being printed, but highly

were ready to defi-ay the expenses of print-
