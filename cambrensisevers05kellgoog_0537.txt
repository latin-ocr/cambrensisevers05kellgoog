Cocli, i. e. red, as an epithet for the Ithian or Spanish Oelts, may agree with the remark
of Tacitus on the Silures of Britain: ‘⁴ Color-ati vultus ..... Iberos veteres traJeeisse,
fiam &niumm-Amicam, 1 1.

4th. After a glorious reign of some 1000 years, the Spanish colony was brought to
the vel-ge of ruin, we arc told, by a great conspiracy of all the plebeiam or Athach-tuatha,
in the commeneement of the Christian era. There is not a shadow of evidence for the
1000 years? reign. 1 have already given my opinion of the foundation of the Irish mo-
narchy in those ages, by the Eiremonian, and, perhaps, Eiberian Belgae, who commeneed
by conquering the midland districts, and gradually extended their sway over the whole
island. We should naturally expect that, during the proffess of the Roman arms in Gaul
and Britain, the kindred Celtic tribes of Eire, though not invaded, should feel the shock.
And in truth it is in those very ages that the scene of most of om· romantio tasss is laid 2-
all is confusion ς province fights against province3 “ the ghoets that stalk through the
twilight os tradition '³ begin to acquire something like the distinctness of a histor-Ic age.

In conclusion, the chief object in proposing this theory of ‘⁶ Irish invasions” is to
elicit from scholare, who are better acquainted with Irish manuscripts and tradition, a
more consistent theory on Pagan [reland. We have had a surfeit of etymologica} and
imaginary monumental Irish ethnology. It may be said that the ancient glory of the
country is renounced. But it is enough that [reland was one of the most ancient Christian
monarchies in Europe3 that no country, its means considered, made a more heroic a‘nd suc·
eessful battle against the Danes ; that, during more than five centur-ies, Ireland was synony·-
mous with learning and piety in western and centra] Europe3 and that, if England took
precedence of France in the Genera] Council of constance, it was because the King of
England was Lord 'of the ancient kingdom of Ireland.-Hib. Dominio-ana, p. 807.
