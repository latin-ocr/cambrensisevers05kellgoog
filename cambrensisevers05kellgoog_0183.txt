writes: “ Some persons cell the Isle of Man in Latin ‘ Eubonia,’ pro-
bably because it was peopled by that same Irish rece which peopled
Euboniae, or, as some call them, ‘ the Hebrides.’ ” In another place
he adds, “ that the inhabitants of Man spoke the Scotic or Irish, which
were one and the same.” Camden too writes: ‘⁶ That in the reign of
Arcadius end Honorius, Man, as well ss boland, was ” (as Orosius
declares) “occupied by tribes of the scote, and thet a Scot, named Builoe
or Bnile, had possession-of it, as we learn from N ennim2.” Selden also
says, ‘⁶ that not Ireland alone, but Men, and the other isles ol* the ,
western Ocean, end a large portion of the North of Britain, were, at
the fall of the Roman Empire, held by the Scots.” “ Scoti,” he adds, Ι
“ was a nanie osten given to the Irish by the ancients.”

Among the many arguments by which Camden proves the Britons -
were descended from the Gauls, the principel are a similerity of customs
and identity of the language spoken by both natione. The identity of
language he regards es ‘⁶ the chief support of his position, end the most
certain evidence. of descent.” “ No person, 1 think, can deny,” he says,
‘⁶ that nations which use the seme language must have been from the
same stock. Though all the histories of all nations had perished, and
no ,mam had ever stated in a book that we English sprung from the
Germens, the Scotch from the Irish, and the Britons of Armorica from
our Britons, yet the bond of a cominon language would clearly estab-
lish it, yes, more clearly than the testimony of the most unexception-
able writersss’ Now, as Camden himself declares that the language and
customs of the inhabitants of Man bear a close resemblance to the Irish, ,
’ it cannot be denied that the Manks are descended from the Irishu. M'
