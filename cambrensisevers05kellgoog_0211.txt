that they quivered their tongues speaking it3 but it appears he sorgot
what Barnabas Rich assume us was a common saying in Ireland: ‘⁴ that
ten Englishmen would adopt Irish‚ for the one Irishman who would
adopt English habite.” Stenihurst adds& that the inhabitants of the
citios, Fingall”, Meath⁰‚ Louth end Wexfordv counties‚ spoke English¹13

Ρ Not the present eounty, but the ba-
rony of Fortia, or territory “ bayed and en-
closed within the river called the Pill, where
ifanlrishman (which was rane in old times)
hul spoken mah, the Wexfordians would
command him forthwith to turn the other
end of his tongue and speak English, or
else bring his trenchman with him. But in
our days (the sixteenth century) the>⁷ have
so acquainted themselves with the Irish, as
they have made a mingle mmgle or galli-
mmffie of both the languagoe, and have
in such medlie or eheckerwise so crabbedlie
jumbled them both together, as commonly
the inhabitants of the meaner sort speak
neither good English no'r good mah!-

of opinion that the barony of Forth was
held by a Flemish colony, an offshoot, of
the Flemish planted near Havoetordwest in
Wales by Hem-y 1. But the Flemish of

seclusion of the barony ofForth might pre-
serve the few characteristics that distin-
guished the Flemish language from the eog-
nate English. The Wexfordian must pro-
bably have been, ·in the sixteenth century,
very‘different from the English, as an Eng-
lish commissioner‚ who was sent over, con-
gratulated himself on his rapid progress in
the Irish, because he was able to under-
stand odd words and sentences from the
Wexford pensante. The simple commis-

sioner ‘⁴ thought the blunt people had pret—
tled Irish all the while they jangled Eng-
liah.”-D0m··pt2·0n of laland, p.‘4.

¹¹ That is, English was spoken in the‘
Pale, but not English only. So early as
1466, 100 years before stanihurst, there
were ‘⁶ multitudes ” of native Irish in the
four ahiree, and all were bound by statute
the same year to keep English bewe, ‘⁸ &they
could epea& Enqlish.” Then also the Irish
of the Pale were ordered to renounee their
Irish names, and adopt the names'of towns,
or colors, or trades, as sutton, chester, διο.
ιω white, Graan, Brown, &a &0- 3 Smin,
carpenter, Taylor‚ stc. διο. They were
ordered to take the oath of allegiance before
the Deputy, or any person appointed by him,
“ sor the multitude which is to be sworn.”
-ῙνὺΙι statuta, vol. i. p. 29. This changing
of the names was the same poliey which
prohibitae the Helots to wea'r distinctiva
dresses, lest they might know their num-
bers and strength. Thirty years later, in
1495, under Henry VIL, the Statute os
Kilkffinffi the grand palladium of Anglo-
Irish legislatiom was repealed, so far as it
prohibited the Irish language in the Pale.”
...lbid., p. 47. This irresistible progress of
the native lang-uage, even during Elizabeth’s
reign, is thus deplored by Stanihurst: “The
Irish language was free denizened in the
English Pale. This canker took such deep
root, as th‘e body that before was whole and
sound, was by little 'and littlvfesteress'and
in manner wholly putrified.”-..Descn·ption
of Ireland, p. 4.
