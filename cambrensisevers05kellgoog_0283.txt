cantrede‚ namely‚ Triucha na gClann, Triuchafan-Chomair‚ and *Triucha

Ui-Eirc.

The list of the Munster chieftains is next composed, among whom
he sets down O'Briein¹‚ as king, sometimes of the two MunsterS‚ and
sometimes of all Ireland3 the king’e 'relative Mae Mathghamhnan or

and the racc of Cathaeir Mor, the task of
describing whom devolved upon himself.

It should b'e here remarked that the list
of the subdivisione, chieftaine, and dynasts
⁶ of Osraidhe‚ above given δὲ Dr. Lynch

from O’Dubhagain's poem, is very imper-

·fect, and that o‘h-Uidhfin gives 'a much
more curione one. He mentions tho follow·
ing in addition to those furnished by O’Du-
bhagainz 1, O’Dubhshlaine, now Delany ι
of Coill-Uachtarach‚ now Upper Woodg
at the foot of Sliabh Bladhma, or Slieve
Bloom; 2, O'Broithe, now Brophy, of Magh-
Sedna, in the present barony οἳ Galm0y3
3, O’Faelain, now Pnelan, in Magh- Lacha,
in the barony of KeUs3 4, O’Caibhdhea-
naigh, now Gaffiny, in Magn-Airbh, in
the present barony of Crannpgh ς 5, O'Gloi-
aim, in a cantred along the River Gallam,
called “ a sweet district ;’' 6, O'Caelluidhe,
now Kell y, in Ui-Be'archon‚ along the Biver
Barrow‚ now forming the north portion of ’
the barony of Ida, in which Ros-I-Bear-
chon, anylice Rosbercon, still preservee the
name.

It should be also here marked, that the
present barony of' Ui-Deaghaidh, or Ida,
comprieeethree ancient beronice shown on
old maps, and still distinctly remembered by
tradition, mimely, Ida, 1gr1n, and nmen,
anciently Ui-Deaghaidh, Ui gCruin12, a quot
Sliabh gemina, now Tory-hill, and Ui-⁴
Barchon. The name of the ancient chief
of Ui gemina is nowhere mentioned, nor

is that of the chief of Ui Deaghaidh3 but,
according to local tradition, the chief of the

Ui- Deaghaidh took the hereditat-y sumame ·

of O'Deaghaidh or O'Dea; and this seems
true, for, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth‚
Thomas O'Dea held a considerable estate
in this barony, as os the manor of Graney.
