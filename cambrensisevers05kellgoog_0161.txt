and holy things, that their incantatione, like poison, may work more
secretly. But the rain brought down by witchcraft should not have
been opposed by witchcraft. Martin Delrio proves, by the. soundest
arguments, and the authority of the most unexceptionable theologiam,
that evil spells cannot be used against evil spells, because evil ought
not be done that good may follow. Gerald’s object, I am sure, in de-
tailing this fabrication, was ,to make the world believe the Irish Church
authorized public superstitious, and to brand with infamy the discipline
of her clergy’. But I shall prove at length that the Irish Church wne,
at that time, too well versed in the best principles to allow so foul a
blot to stain her fair name. Many similar instances of Gerald’s irreve-
rence to the saints themselves occur in this volume. The following

comes in naturally⁴ here, as we are on the topographicsl, part of his

work z

'·“ An island,” he says, ‘,‘ in a certain lake² in Ulster, is divi’ded into Ι

and misrepresentations by which the Popish
system kept its hold on the ininds of the
simple and ignorant people.”—-(p. 158). Ι
But if Mr. Wright had consulted Dr. Lani-
gan (vol. i. p. 368), he would not iden·-
tiry the history of St. Patrick’s Purgatory
with the Popish system, since Dr. Lanigan
was an humble believerin that system, and
yet he had no belief in the popular history
of the Purgatory of Lough Derg. Mr.
Wright also states that “as long as the
monks retained their influence in Spain, the
Purgatory stories were taught in their gross-
est forms.”-(p. 172). From an examina-
tion of this latter position, the reader can
eefimate the degree of credit due to Mr.
Wright on catholic-matters in Franco and
Spain. In the last oennuy, a Spanish monk‚
the General of the Benedictineffi Fray Be-

nito Geronymo Feijoo· published, with the x

approbation of his own order, as well as of
the Jesuits, cistercians, and others, a series
of essays against popular errors. The es-
says are on the plan of Addison‘s Spectator,
and they have acquired for their author a

European reputation, and a place in Spanish .
literature equal, and in science superior, to
what Johnson or Addison holds in the Eng-
lish. Now, among those essays there is

vaone which Mr. Wright (who cites many

other Spanish books, p. 173) has most un-
accountably overlooked, though it is on

St. Patrick's Purgatory, “ Ίζήεαινο critico,

tom. vii. p. 157, ed. 1755.” Feij00 com·

He says they are “ehaff:” “Paja llamo
