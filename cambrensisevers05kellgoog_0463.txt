Qlill Fiunn, ascending the throne, reigned eleven years, after which A. G.
he was alain in the battle of Odba⁸, by Argetmar and Duach Ladhghrach, ff
A. M. 4415.
The men of Munster, rallying around the standard of Eochaidh, son 893
of Olill Fionn, expelled Argetmar from the island. But after an exile
of seven yearS‚ Argetmar returned‚' and, entering into alliance with
Duach Ladhghrach‚ attacked and slew Eochaidh at Aina⁸, A. Μ. 4422.
Argetmar, having at length gained the object of his long-cherished 391
aspir-inge, governed the kingdom peaceably during thirty yearS. He
was slain by Duach Ladhghrach and Lughaidh Laighde, A. M. 4452.
Duach Ladhghrach at length attained the royal object of his ambi· 881
tion3 but, after a reign of ten years, he was slain by Lughaidh Laighdhe,
A. M. 4462. The surname Ladhghrach was derived from the words
‘⁶ luath agra,'' meaning swift vengeance, or the very prompt infliction of
punishment, because every person detected by him in the commission
of crime was not allowed to move from the spot, but at once suffered
the penalty of the law.
- Lughaidh Laighdeb was slain after a reign of eight years by Aedh 371
Ruadh, A. M. 4469. -
Aedh Ruadh reigned twenty-one yearS, but not without interruption. 867

‘JA very old authority cited by O'Co·
nor (Proleqom. pars ii. p. lxvi. ), namely,
a poem attributed to Fortchern, “omnium
hactenus memoratorum antiquissimum,”
traeing the genealogy' of Cimbaoth the
Irim, makes him eiyhth in desoent from
Ollamh Fodhla, and includes among the

Fortchern be right, Ollamh may have lived
some 240 years before Cimbaoth‚ and not
about 589, as Dr. Lyneh will have it, or
about 320 according to O’Flaherty. It is
to be remarffed that, with very few excep-
tione, there is less discrepancy in the pe-
riods assigned to those Irian than to the
other reign83 and that, of the three, the
Eiremonian are hitherto the most uncertain.
The Irian line was continued in the kings
of Eamania, who claimed all the glory of
Ollamh Fodhla as their own. From him
the Ultonians were called Ullum—Proleq.
