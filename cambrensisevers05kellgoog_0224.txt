Praeterea Hibernici Reguli, redditus ‘et tributum quod vulgo nigrum
dicebatur„ ab' Anglicae provinciae limitibus referebantfflz quos tamen
66118118, ente 28 Henrici VIII. et Christi 1537 annum, comitia non sus-
tulerunt. Eadem quoque comitia sanciverunt, ut, in ditionibus Hiber·
norum imperio parentibuS, homicidii reis mulcta quadrag-inte librarum
irrogaretur, querum viginti Rex Angliae, et alias viginti! ditionis To-
parcha perciperet³⁵3 et ut minoris furti quatuordecim denarios non
superantis convictae, pro mulctfi, quinque mercen, utpote viginti sex
solidos et octo denarios Toparchae, ejus autem successori designato vi-
ginti solidos persolveret: annuentibus nimirum Anglis ut Hiberniei
Reguli suis limitibus, legibue, et vectigalibus libere potirentur. Ita

[20] ut pace subinde ao pactione utraque pars Ι devincta fuisse videatur.

Plurimis enim. horum a suis tribulibus injuriam perpessis opem illi

Davi-9, p. 148. Carlow‚ and the gresten· part
'ot' Wexford, were seized by Art Mac Mur-
rough in 1327 ; and his descendants, in con-
junction with the O’Byrnes and O’Tooles of
Wicklow, held thirty miles of country from
the Bari-ow to the sea, during more than
two causarios-Hamis, Hib„ p. 81. The
native Irish of South Kilkenny and Tippe-
rary, Limerick‚.East Cot-k, Weber-ford, and
a large portion of Kerry, never rose after
the conquest ς and English law was in force
in Kilkenny and 'I‘ipperary until about the
year 1478.-.-Ibid., p. 102. Munster, from
Limerick to Oak, was also obedient to the
King’s laws during 160 years from the
¹conquest (ibid, p. 83), that is, until the
memorabIe year 1342, when the Anglo-
Irish Lords assembled in convention ⁸⁸‚Kss‘
kenny, complained to >the King that the
native Irish had reconquered one-third of
their old territorias. They also stated:
‘⁶ Ensement sire vos chasteaux de Rosco·
man, Randon, et Athlon‚ Ruunt, et autrez
ehasteaux et foreeletz qe deussent estre
en votre mein et par queux tot le pais

entour soleit estre confort et defende, si
sont ore en mein des Irreys enemys.”—
Liber Mun„ part iv. p. 32. Whoever
would study Irish history from 1172 to the
accession of Henry vm„ must take 1342
as one of his epochs. The native Irish never
lost, but rather continued to extend the
power which they had then regeined.

f The black mail or tribute paid to the
native Irish in 1515 is known from the
State Paper-s (vol. ii. part iii. p. 9). 0’00-
nor had 3300 from the county Meam, and
1:20 from Kildare3 O’Neiu os clannaboy,
240 from the barony of Lecale3 O'Neill of
'lyr-one, 240 from Louth30’Car1-011, 5:40
from Kilkenny3 the county of Limerick
paid ³840 to O'Brien of Arragh‚ and 1:40
to the great O'Brien3 Mac Murrough re-
ceived 240 from werdoni, and eighty marks
from the King’s Exchequer. The Editor
cannot ascertain at what precise time these
counties thus became tributary to the na·
tive Irish. Mac Μαι-1011311 enJoyed his
eighty marks from the reign of Edward 111.
