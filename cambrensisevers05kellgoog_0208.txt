ad eam addiscendam nullas pateat accessus, cum tamen homo Ger·
manus Coloniae natus Matthaeus Doringii eques auratus sic in ejus
adyta penetravit, ut, nostra memoria, Grammaticam Hibernicam con-
diderat. Deinde narrat quendam a daemone insessum Romae, aliis lin·
guis locutum, Hibernice loqui vel noluisse, vel non potuisse, quia nimi-
rum (ut ille jocatur) lingua tam sacra, ore tam sordido profan-ari non
debuit3 vel potitis, ut innuit, quod asperitate tanta horruit, ut daemon
ipse illius ignoratione laboraverit. Linguae quidem Hibernicae ignoran-
tiam ad alienissimam de ills conj ceturam faciendam eum adduxit non
secus ac Hispanus ille tanta severitate Germanicam ‘linguam praeditam
esse ratus est, ut crediderit Adamum a Deo, majoris ei terroris incu-
tiendi causa, lingua Germanica increpitum fuisse. Cui Germanus re-

ut persuasum habuerit, eam a serpente adhibitam csse, cum Evam frau—
dum et callidorum consiliorum tragulis circumvenire statuisset.
Hinc autem Hibernicae linguae suavitas magis quam horriditas elucet,

glicam ab Hibernis, plus expeti conqueritur: cum etiam Hibernos
Anglice loquendo mentum torquere dedignari dicat; populares suos a
sermone Hibernico aeque aversos non esse ac linguam Hibernice gar-

¹Stanihurst speaks not of the Irish com-
monly· spoken, but of the “true irish‚'’
which was so different from the other “that
scarcely one in five hundred can read, write,
or understand it. And in very deed the
language carrieth such difficulty with it,
what for the strange-neas of the phrase and
the curious statne„ of the pronunciation,
that a very few of the country can attain
to the pei-fection themoi} and much less a
foreigner or stranger‚”-a position true, as
far as it regarded “ the pei-fection ’' οι· the
ancient language and pronunciation.

JThis Matthew de Rienzi was a German,
and descendant of the famous Scanderbeg.
He obtained a grant from James I., in
1622, οι· 1000 acres of the forfeited Irish
landa· ιιι the barony οι· Garrycastle, King' s
County, on condition that he would not

adopt the title of O' Boi-ke, Ο· Mulloy, or
any Irish chieftaim nor sanction the Bre-
hon law on his property. His epitaph, in
the ‘chin-eh of Athlone, states that he com-
posed not only an Irish grammar, but a
dictionary, and a chronicle, in the same
tongue. These works, if extant, are not
known. He died in 1634.-Hardiman’s
Statute os Kilkenuy, p. 12.

ported that he did see a woman in Rome,
possessed with a babbling spirit, that-could
have chatted any lang-uage save the Irish‚
and that it was so very difficult as the dex-il
was gravelled therewith. montleman that
stood by, answered that he took the speech to
be so sacred and holy that no damned flend
