for seven years, he reigned during the first seven, and resigned it then Δ. c.
to Dithorb, from whom, after the lapse of the same space, it came to'
Cimbaoth. The crown, by this revolving succession, was enjoyed by
each three timec, thus completing twenty-one years. Aedh Ruadh was
drowned in tffe waterfall in T iroonnel, which has thence been called
Easroe⁶3 ‘⁴ eas’' being the Irish word for torrent or cataract. He
was drowned A. M. 4490.

Dithorb also reigned twenty-one years in the manner which has just 360
been described. He was elain in Corann· by Cuanman Cuanmoighe,
and Cuansleive‚ his brother-’s sons, A. M. 4511.

Ciombaoth, by the same revolving succession, reigned twenty-one 353
years. His wife, Mache, the daughter of Aedh Ruadh, having, on the
death of the latter, taken the field in defence of her right to re'ign,
defeated her competitore, and thus added seven other years to her hus-
band’s reign. At the close of that period he was seized with a mortal
illness, and died at Eamania‘, A. M. 4539. ‚

After the death of Cimbaoth, the sons of Dithorb demanded that, in' 346
virtue of the law of septennial successim, established by the consent of
their fatherS‚ they should enjoy the throne3 but Macha replied that
she had won the kingdom by the sword, and that the sword alone could ⁸
wrest it from her. They flew to arms in defence of their right, but
were routed and taken prisonem, and conducted in chains to her palace.
Mache reigned seven years after the death of her husband, and com-
pelled the sons of Dithorb to work in the erection of the Palace of
Emania, which afterwards became the chief seat of the Ulster kings.
Thus Colgan writes: ‘⁴ The royal residence of the Ulster kings was
Emania, or Emhonmacha, near Ardmach. The deep fosseS, the piles of

crumbling walls& and rampartS, still attest the ancient grandeur of the
palaceh.” Macha was killed by Reachtach, A. 'M. 4546.
