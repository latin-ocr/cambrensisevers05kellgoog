Plutarch confesses in his life of Demosthenes, that he had not a
good knowledge of the Latin huguage, and hence, though so eminent
in other departments, he fell into some errors on the ancient history
of Rome. Appian's eri-ors, on the same subject, arose from the same
cause. No writer has left us a more diligent and detailed account of
the civil wars of the Romans; but, being an Egyptian, he was not per·
fect master of the old language of Rome· Diodorus differs in almost
every page of his Roman antiquities from Dionysius and Livy, in con-
sequence, as Bodinus thinks, of his ignorance of the Latin language.
The errors of those writers arose from ignorance, not from a design to
mislead. What ‚the Greeks and Romans wrote of the Celts, and the
Romans of the Hebrews and chaldeam, are, in like manner, generally
found to bc salse.

A foreigner might perhaps do some justice to contemporaneous his-
tory, or events of no distant date, such as the a'ctions of the fathers,
grandfatherS, or great-grandfathers of the men of his own day3 but he
never can trace, with any success, the original peopl ing of a country, or
the ancient origin of a nation. The ancient languages are indispensably
necessary for tracing the origin of nations; and it is in the language
of barbatiane, as being the most ancient, “ that we may find, as Plato ·
teachesin Cratylus‚ those primitive words, which are long since obso-
lete.” Diodorus Siculus not only (as he tells us) “ compiled his history

of the Roman state from the ancient national archives, but also made ·

himself well acquainted with the Roman language3 so true is the obser-—
vation that ignorance of the original language is a great bar to know· ⁴
ledge.’' For, according to Bodinus‚ “ there are three tests for tracing

j and deciding on the origin of nations3 first, the testimony of trust-

worthy writers3 next, the' relies of its ancient tongue3 and, thirdly‚
the geographical position and description of the country.” Such also
appear to‘have been Camden’s views, as announced in the following ex·
tract: “ 1 have neglected nothing that could be of any use in throwing
light on the obscure facts of ancient history. I have acquired a know·
ledge of the Anglo-Saxon, and of the most ancient British language.
1 have travelled through every part of Enghnd, and examined the
public documenta os the realm, and archives and libraries.” In this
he only followed the example of the ancients3 for it has been usual

³ with the best writers, in order to give weight to their werke, to pro-
