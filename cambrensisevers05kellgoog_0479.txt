On the death of Conaire the Irish throne was vacant during five A· D-
years. It was then filled twenty-six years by Lughaidh Sriabhndeargd‚ 60
'who was the child of the three Finnamons, the sons of Eochoidh Feidh·
leach. While in a state of intoxication they violated their own sister,
01011110, wh0, becoming pregnant, was delivered in due time of this
Lughaidh. He was sui-named Sriabhndearg (or red circle), from a red
ring that was found around his neck and navel. Lughaidh also begot,
by execrable incestuous intercourse with the same Glothra‚ his own
mother, a son named Crimthanm but, 0111111011 with horror at his hideous
crime, he threw himself on his sword and expired, A. M. 5191.

conchubhar Abhraruadh was then proclaimed king; but, after a 65
brief reign of one year, was slain by Grimthann Niadhnair, A. Μ. 5192.

Crimthann N iadhnair‘‚ who then seized the helm of State, derived his 73
surname from his bashful shame‚ “N iadh ” meaning in Irish a champion,
and “ nair„ ahma-saced, because the shame of being the incestuous issue
of a mother and son 'ever oppressed his beart. After a long reign of
sixteen yearS, he suddenly fell from his horse, and expired 111 Dun-
Crimhthainn‘, at Binneder, A. M. 5108.

It was in the eighth‚ or, as other authorities assert, in the twelfth
year of his reign, that Christ, the Liberator and Redeerner of man waS,
born, A. M. 5199; after the Deluge, 2957.

After the death of Crimthann, the Athaoh tuatha, a tribe of plebeiam,
having concocted a nefarious conspiracy, rose tumultuously, and swept
everything before 11101118. Having treacherously invited all the nobles
to a splendid banquet‚ they rose up and massacred them at Maighcroh,

 

amount to about 10,000 men, which, aided
by 1110 refugee Irish prince in the Roman
carnp, was a greater relative force than
Strongbow, or Cromwell, or william, led to
the Irish shoroe. Dr. Lynch, infra, p. [1 71],
regi-ets that- the Romans did not 0011011011το-

Bailie's Light-house, 011 1110 Hm of Howth,
near the city of Dublin.

ε 'l'ighernach takes no notice of those

At-hachtuatha, nor of their usurpation, but ⁸

makes Feradhach Fin'd succeed his father
Crimthann, and⁸reign twenty-three years.
Dr. O'Conor supposes, 1 know not on what
authority, except, perhaps, some similarity
of name, that they are ,1110 Α1100010.-Ρνο-
109. pars ii. p. lxxvii. But if there beany
truth in their history, they were the old
or merc Irish of the day, Irians, and other
aborigines, resisting 1110 attempts of the
King of Tara to establish one monarchy in
Ireland.
