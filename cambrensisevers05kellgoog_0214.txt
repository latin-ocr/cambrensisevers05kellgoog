Colligere porro mihi videor a sacris literis (dicentibus qued “ J abal fuit
pater habitantium‘in tentoriis atque pastorum, J ubal pater canentium
cythara et organn, et Tubalcain malleator et faber in cuncta opera aeris
et serri¹³,”) recentibus illis ab orbe condito mortalibus familiare fuisse,
ut singulis artibus exercendis stati tribus impliciti tenerentur: et
ab illis sicut originem, sic etiam similem consuetudinem ad posteros
dimanasse. ’ ‘

· Sed ut interruptum de lingua Hibernici'i sermonem rursus instau-
remus. Ea per omnes Hiberniae regiones sic hodie diffusa est ut ubique
ferme fit vernacula. Itaque mirum non est, Giraldo scribente, Anglisque
primum huc appulsis, et latiores ditionum fines nondum consecutis, si
ea suis omnibus ornamentis ad amussim insignita floruerit. Ao proinde
neque tunc neque nunc temporis Anglicae linguae usus ab Hibernis fre—
quentatus gentis sub Anglorum potestatem redactae tessera non fuerit.

N eo e vestis Anglieae gestatione argumentum elici possit, quod Hi-
bernos suae potestati subjecerunt. Vestis enim Anglica nunquam

Hibernis ante nostram memoriam vulgo usitata fuit. Nimirum illinon
ea laborabant inconstantia, ut instar Protei ad omnem vestis formam
ab Anglis indies excogitatam, se vertant: ‘⁴ Itaque Barnabas Riehius

O'Donovan.

‘ The interpretation here given by Dr.
Lynch is not supported by any respectable
authority. ‘⁶ Father ” means simply “ in·—
ventor,” not that he transmitted his trade
as an‘heirloom in his family.

⁸¹ It is a sad and curicus speculation what
might now be the* state of the Ιϊίιιὶι4 lan-
guage if the Irish had not risen in 1641, nor
Cromwell ever visited our shores. Proba-
bly one of the national demands to-day
would be to make the Irish the official lan-
guage, as the Bohemians, the Hungarians,
and the Peles in Posen aud Gallicis have
lately insisted on a similar restoration.

⁸ This inference, as far as it regards the
Irish language, is τινος but if it imply that
English was not more generally sp0ken bess

fore the Statnte of Kilkenny, 1365, than
afterwards, it is opposed to history. That
statute declares that, ‘⁸ at the Conquest‚ and
a long time after? the English used the
‘⁴ lang Engleys,” but that now many Eng-
lish had forsaken that language. ⁸ And it
is highly probable that for a few genera-
tions the settlers spoke a language which
was not Irish3 but was it English ¹? Many
of the settlers were Welsh‚ whose cognate
language would soon be lost in the Irish3
the nobles were Normans, many of whom
probably preferred the French lang-uage..-
See Rae. Pae. 3, 4 Edw. 11. 573 and idem,
iii. 4. The English spoken by the settlers of
Saxon race was the only formidabis anta-
gonist to the Irlsh, especially as it found
in Dublin, Limerick, and other towns, the
scandinaviam branch of the Teutonio, al·—
