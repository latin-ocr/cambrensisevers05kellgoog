first historic Eiremoniau king3 but his territory was confined to Leinster and Connaught,
i. e. Gailian and Olnegmacht.-Round Tomers, p. 99. Lughaidh became the first Eire-
monian king of Leath Cuinn3 his son, Crimthan, naturally leaves his burial ground at
Cruachnn for Brugh; and with Crimthan's son, Feradhach the Just, commences, accord·-
ing ιο Chai-les O’Conor, the first authentic Eiremonian genealogy.-Note ¹¹, p. 494, supra.
Lughaidh was, therefore, the founder of that northern kingdom which gradually acquired
a permanent ascendancy in the island, and preserved theneeforward the most correct genea-
logy of its kings.

Another proof of the modern date of the Eiremonian family may be taken from the
admission of O'Flaherty himself, that all the Eiremonians were descended from the dubious
and comparatively modern personages, AEngus ‘lhirmeach and Loegaire Lorc (supr-cl,
p. 449) ; and how frail the evidence founded on their claims must be, has been proved in
the notes, supra, pp. 445, 446, 447.

The story of the extirpation of the nobles by the Athachtuatha, in the first century,
was another convenient bardic device to conceal the modern origin of the dominant race3
yet novelty is stamped on its whole history. For, from the moment that Crimthan comes
to be buried at Brugh, we can trace, by tradition, the Eiremonian genealogy becoming
consistent in his son, Feradach3 the Eitemonian kingdom assuming something like a
reality in the formation of Meath by Feradach’s grandson, Tuathal Teachtmar (p. 467,
τηρῶ), and the Eiremonian race extending its ascendancy gradually over parts of Mun-
ster (p. 469, note 8, caprei), of Leinster (p. 473), and over nearly all Ulster and Con-
naught (pp. 491, 493, supa-12², before the commencement of the fifth century.

without intending to'deny positively that an Eiremonian, named Ugaine Mor, may
have preceded Labhraidh Loingseach by some years, and conquered those fair districts,
which always have been the first seized by invaders (supra, p. 445), I would fix the real
origin of the Eiremonian powerin Ireland at the invasion of Labraidh Loingseach‚ A. C.
89, 63. According to tradition, Labhraidh came from Gaul, and as Leinster and Con-
naught, which anciently included a large portion of Meath province, were, according ιο all
authorities, and Chai-les O’Conor's map‚ the principal seats of the Firbolg or Belgoe, it is

’ but natural to conchide that Labhraidh's followers were the Belgae, who had long been in

possession of the south of Britain, and of the greater part of Gaul. But here a great diffi-
culty arises: What are we ιο think of the colony of Belgae, which, under the conduct of
Slainghe, seized Ireland even before the Tuatha de Dananns? Is it a fable, or must we
admit, as Thierry admits for Franoe, several Belgio invasions? Or how can we ast-,count for
the marked distinction, preserved even to the seventeenth century, between the Eiremo-
nian and Firbolg genealogies in Connaught? Now, in forming his opinion here, the reader
must remember, lst‚ that a Labhraidh Loingseach was admiral under the traditionary
Slainghe (Proleyom. pars ii, p. lviii. note ⁷), 2ndly, that Ireland was divided into five
provinces by Slainghe, and a similar division was made by the Eiremonian Eochaidh
Feidleach‚ nearly contemporary of Kiny Labhraidh Loingseacht, 3rdly, that, according to
Keatinffi the Firbolgs, who had been expened by the Tuatha de Dana'nns, suddenly· return
ιο Ireland, no one knows how, after more than 1000 years, and acquire lands in Leinster
and Gonnaught at the very time when the Pentarchy was revived[?] by Eochaidh Feidleach
