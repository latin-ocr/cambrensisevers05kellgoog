cussing. ,It was a pitiful subterfuge to appeal to the power of God‚

who abominates lies above all things. No-—the brand of infamy, burned

on Giraldus during life, cleaves to himin his grave. Far the greater part

of his work is not entitled to any credit, for he himself expressly de-

clares that truth had not been his sole guide. “ Ι do not expect,” he

says, “ that everything 1 write should be rashly believed3 for, with the

exception of what came under my own observation‚ or what could be

easily ascertained, my own belief in my narratione is not fixed and un-

hesitating, I give them without pronouncing on their truth or false-

hood.” Here he pleads guilty; for, after telling us that he wrote what

he saw and heard from others, he confesses that even those things are ⁴
not so certain that they ought to be believed, or that even he himself ¹
would affirm or deny them. Now if, by his own confession, there be

such uncertainty in what he saw or heard from others, I ain ata loss to ¹
know what claims his book can have to authority? 1 am not so preju-

diced against him as to disbelieve what he tells me he witnessed3 but

the narratives founded on the authority of his “ trustworthy country-

men’⁵ 1. reject and contemn2 The leaders of the invasion are stigmatized

by Newbury as ‘⁶ needy and avaricious adventurers ;” and by Giraldus

himself as ‚traitors‚ or robbers, or murder-ers, or rebels, or criminale.

Vague rumor was, therefore, the sole ground of his book} and when,

during his life-time, he was ,vehem'ently denounced‚ and his 'statemen ts

often branded as lice, he shifted the blame from himself to public ru-

mor. It was his only authority.

If a confession of the truth had not been violently extorted from
him, he never could have been shamed into the following admission:
⁶⁶ With regard to my Topography of Ireland,-—-that respectable work,
and almost the first from my pen, in which so many strange things and
utterly unknown in other countries are recorded,--I would have it dis-
tinctly known that some, nay many, of the facts therein recorded, were
derived from accurate and most searching inquiries among some of
the greatest and safest authorities m that country3 on other points 1
have rather followed the popular rumours of the land3 and of them Ι
hold the opinion of St. Augustin, who, speaking m his City of God, of

’ those things which rest merely on report, without any cert& ground , Ι

²of tr uth, decides, that generally they are of such a character that we
cannot either admit or positively deny them? ’² From this it clearly
