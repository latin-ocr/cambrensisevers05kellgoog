He was the most inveterate enemy of the Irish nation; ‘⁸ the able ad·-
viser,” as he calls himself, “ of Fitzstephen and Philip Barry, the arch
enemies of Ireland.” St. Paul, by guarding the clothes of those who
stoned St. Stephen, may be said to have “nerved the arms of all the
persecutors against the saint:” so Giraldus’s counsel worked as much
evil as the swords of all the soldiers. Commendas get the glory,
soldiers the labor of victory.

‘⁸ Counsel more sure than strength in tented flelds;
The soldier’s nerve for victory’s laurels wields.”

So the man who advises the crime is more guilty than he who perpe·
trates it. “ For it is not by swiftness nor strength, nor agility of body,
that great things are done, but by counsel, authority, and judgment;’'
a truth confirmed by Tacitus: “greater things are done by consum-
mate prudence than by brute force;” by Valerius Flaccus: ‘⁴ skill is
often more efficient than force ;” and by Euripides also:

‘⁴ One prudent mind o'er myriad hands prevails 3
Where counsel is not, nothing else avails.”

Cicero has justly said, “ that prudence in „council is more desii-able
than courage in the field, for to rush to the battle rashly, and to engage
with the enemy, is something preposterous, and like the brute beasts.
Arms are powerless abroad, if there be not prudence at home.”

The excesses of a foreign soldiery in Ireland, the devastation of her
provinces, the plunder and conflagration of her houseS, and the mas-
sacre of her sons, must be all laid at Giraldus’s door. It was his guilty
counsel that inflamed the fury of the invaders against the kingdom of
Ireland. He alone has to answer for 811 the havoc of the most unjust
war ever carried on during the memory of man. He it was who steeled
the hearts of the invaders· Have we not the best reason to 0811 him an
