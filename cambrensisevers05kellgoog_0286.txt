De Clare, end the enpuleion of hie abettore,
the Ui-Bloid, by the triumphent rece of Tur.
lough-na-caithreime, the O’Brien gave the
MacNamaras possessiones an extensive ter—
ritory lying between the River Fergue and
the Shmon, the exact limite of which, in
1584, are defined in e MS. aoeount of Tho·-
mund,- or the eounty of Clare, preserved in

the Library of Trin. Gon„ Dublin, E..2‚14. ,

⁰ This ie a misako, for O’Duibbginn (now

unque& Duggan and Deegin) was chier ’
of numer connlaohtaigh. O'Gradffi, now .
O’Grady, was chief of Cinel-Dunghaile a ,

tribe yriginelly seated in the ραι-1311 of Kil-
linasoolagh, , near the River Fergue; but
efter the expuleion of the Ui-Bloid, and
‘the killing o( De Clare, the cinei* Dun-
ghnile or O’Gredys, were removed to Tunim-
Greine [Tomgraney], where they obtained
possession of a territory eomprising the pa·
rishesofTomgraney,Moyno‚1nisealtra, and
Clonrush, of which the two latter ere now
included iwthe eounty of Galway, -though
still belonging to the Deleaseian dioeeee of
Killeloe, and to the deanery of o-mmoid.

Ρ Now Liddy. The Ui—Dobhnrehon, who
were a subsectiou of the Ui·mBloid‚ were
seoted in the territory which belonged to

the O’Gmdys sinoe 1318, q. v.
9, ¹ This ie a mere blunder. There were

no such familiee ae O'Dungling or O’Rig-
migh, in Dal-gomis. Mac Goumara was
chief of Ui·gCaisin.

,⁸ This should be ‘⁵ O’Eehthighern, dynast
of Ui-Cearnaigh in Ui-mBloid.” O'th-
thighern is now englieieed Ahern, nenne,
and Heron. The position of Ui·0eermigh
appears from Mae Namara’e rental, pub-
lish'ed by Hardimen in the 'I'raneaetione of

the Royel Irish Aeedemy, vol. κὴ. It oom— 1

prised ,the pari‘sh of Kilfineghty, end some
of the district lying between that pai-iah
and theeity ofLimeriek. Thenemeie
still locally known, end the position of the
territory defined by the Ogarney River‚
anciently eelled the fluite, whieh' flows -
through the little town of six-Mile-Bridgo‚
and unites with the Shannon at Bau-Ram,
i. e. Rene-mouth, now Bunratty. This
river flowe through the very middle of Ui·
Ceernaigh, from a pleee near the castle of
Emghofloyne te Roesmanagher, ester peso-
ing which it forme the boundery between
the Ui-cearnaigh and 'Ptodraidhe

⁸ This is certainly a blunder. O’h-Uidh-
rin makes O’Neill, who was one of the Ui-
Bloid, chief of Tradreidhe, and we know
from the beet authorities that Mne Coch-
lain, of the raee of Dal-goeio, was chief ot·
Dealbhna-Eathra, now the barony of Gar-
tymme, in the King's County. The name

and the exact extent of the fertile and· .

beautiful territory of Tradteidhe, anqlice
Trndsy, is preserved in the deenen-y oi*
Trachy, which compi-iseo the parishea of
Tomfinlough‚ Killonasoolagh, Kilmeleery,
