very position of the Irian territories is, of
itself, a strong argument that the Irians
balatis against the descendants of his royal preceded the Eireamonians, and were by
brothers. Perhaps we have here a key to them driven from the richer and more ac·
the history of the Milesian family, and that cessible parts os the island. The bards, it
Eiremon, Eiber, and Ir, were brothers, in is true, endeavour ιο explain the diffusion os
the same way as Britus, Albanus, Fran· Irian tribes through Connaught and Mun-

cus and Romanus were brothers, or Gotus,
Burgundus, and Lombardus, or Vandalus
and Saxo (In‘sh Nomius, p. 33); that is,
'um tho Irim were a branca of the cauo
family, settled in Ireland before the branch
represented by Eireamon. According to the
common story, Ireland was divided into
two parts 3 Eireamon took the north, but
granted Ulster ιο his brother Ιη--ῙνίεΙι

of the Boyne to the Bay os Denegal, was,

Maelmura of Othain, from whom the prece-
ding sketch is taken, might truly say, in the
ninth century, bun m h epm oo etmnnln,
“Erin is fullos the race ot· Ir.” The reader,
by comparing the Irian territories with those
of the native Irish in the fourteenth cen-
tury (p. 201, note θ, et seq. caprei), will find
that, with the exception of East Leinster,
they ars nearly identical ; and thus the

ster, by telling us that they were all the
descendants of illegitimate sons of a certain
fugitive Ulster king, named Fergus (It-isle
Nauius, p. 263) 3 but as this man is placed
so far back as the first century, and as the
story of his issue is intrinsically improba·
ble, it is entitled to little or no credit. The
conclusion ιο which Irian topography leads,
is, that the race bad possession of the greater
part of the island, and that conclusion iscon-
firmed by two significant tradition& namely‚

' the great number of Irians who figure in the

lists of archkings of Ireland, before Ugaine
the Great, especially Ollamh Fodhla, with
his seven Irian successors, the kings, if not
the founders of Tara, and next the partition
of Ireland between the two Irian brothers,
Kearmn'a and Sobharchq a partition which
is supported by traditionary monumental
evidence, the palaces of both, in opposite
ends of the island, being yet knon by their
names (supr-d, p. 425, n. ¹¹, p. 431, n. ¹¹),

palace of Eamania was, ‘⁴ without a single
exception, the most extensive of ‘its kind
in Ireland.”—-Ma9h Rath, p. 213, note '-
Its foundation, A. C. 305, its destruction,
