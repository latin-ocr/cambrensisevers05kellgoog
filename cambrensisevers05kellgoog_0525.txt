CHAPTER VIII. OF CAMBRENSIS. EVERSUS.

...ἧ-...η

Bnmnvnm it extremely improbable that any reeearches could fix, with even an approxi-
mation to chronological accmacy, any facts in the pagan history οἵ Ireland, except the few
meagre recorda of Tighearnach, 1 had resolved to edit the eighth chapter of “ cambrensis
Eversus‘' without any annotatione. But, as the work progressed slowly through the Press,
1 was insensibly led to notice some popular opinions, and to correct or complete our author-’s
story by the learned labora of O’Flaherty, Dr. O’Conor‚ and the editors of the Irish Archaeo-
logical Society’s works. There was no intention οἱ proposing a hypothesis. The notes
were intended merely as a correct compilation of the opinions of the most trustworthy

length, inclined me to believe that the publication of the various manuscripts cited by
Dr. O’Conor will enable future investigators to ascertain the principal primifive races of
lreland, the order in which they succeeded each other, and, probably, some leading facts
in the undigested mass of bardic prose and poetry, which has hitherto been dignified with
the title of a history of pagan Ireland.

How far this belief may prove to be only a fancy, engendered by some study of the
subject, the publication of the manuscripts themselves will show. The study was certainly
by no means inviting; it was not inspired by what Mr. Moore terms a ‘⁸ mournfully sig-
nificant” elinging ‘⁴ to the fondly imagined epoch of those old Milesian days‚’‘ which,
unfortunately, have engressed too much valuable time, zeal, and talent, to the neglect of the
Christian agea, when Ireland was another name for piety and learning in most of the lan-
guages of Europe. Neither was there any insensibility to the difficulty of attempting to
explain, by the lights of topographical and genealogical tradition, the suecession and history
of the various Irish Celtic colonies in pagan times, because we all know how insensibly
and rapidly‚ successive colonien of different raceS, had amalgamated in historic and even
Anglo-Norman ages. Thus, 150 years after the first deseent of the Northern pirates on
the Itish shores, the Irish Danes had become Christian and Irish ; 150 years aster the reign
