Grimthanius regnum adeptus plures praedas e Gallia, saxonia, et ³
Albania retulisse dicitur, Illi decimum tertium regni annum pereur-
renti, Mongfionna soror, veneno propinato, sibique vi'tae finem accele-
ravit, ut filius· ejus BrianuS, cujus amore multum prae caeteris filiis
flagrabat, initium regnandi maturi tis faceret. Anno Domini 378,

Mundi §577., .

N ellus cognomento N aogiallech‚ id est noviobses, quod novem ob·

sides quinque scilicet ex totidem Hiberniae regnis, et quatuor ex
Albania, ut ait Ketingus, Temoriae penes se habuit, regnum consecutus

his name to Tirolill, now ‘'litet-rii, a harony'
in the county of Sligo.—- Oyyyz’oe, p. 374.

⁰ Au the monarche of Irenae, from this
Crimthann to Briau Boromha, exclusive,
being of the Eiremonian line, according to
our author, we may dispense henoefflrward

’ with the genealogieal 'reference in our Latin

margin. The sole obJect in printing these
references was the hope that they may sup-
ply some clue in the elucidation of the early
history of 'Il-elam, when all the manuscript
authorities have 'been published; not that
the genealogies are to be regarded as au-
thentic history, for “all our genealogica}
lines, all our regal lists, antecedent to the
reign of Feradach the Just, in the first cen-
tury, bear evident marks of bat-dish forgery.
To extend bach the antiquity of the nation,
generations have been multiplied‚ princes
acknowledged only by their several factione
have been put in regular succession after
each other ” (Oyyyia Vindicatcd, p. 37),
a censure from which none of the genealoa
gics, except the Eiremonian regal line, are
entirely exempt, even after the Ι reign of
Fcradach the Just. What is the value, then,
of those early genealogies? Though false
as history, they may contain an ethnogra-
phical truth, by classifying into different.
families the different races settled ‘in the

country at the time the genealogies were
drawn up. The family, or rather tribe,

being the great, almost the sole clement of

Celtic political life,- the Celtic hard or his- ·

torian would natm-any regard the whole
kingdom as afamily, and arrange its diffe-
rent branches according to their still ex-
isting characteristica, aided, perhaps by
tradition. Hence, when the Irish were de·
riving the descent of many kindred Euro-
pean natione from a certain number of

· brothers,—-Albanus, Britus, Francus, Go-

tus‚ διο. &e (Irisk Nauius, p. 33),—what
was more natural than to apply the same
philosophy, and in the same age, to the
different branches of the Celtic stock in
their own country& and invent the four
Irish patriarcha-Eirmon, Eiber, lr, and
Ith,—to explain the existence of four diffc-
rent Celtic families ἲ This system appears
t'o have attained its full development in the
hands of Moelmura of Fathau, in the ninth
century. — Irish Nemnius, pp. 221, 253.
It does not appear fully in the Rome os
Mayh Rath ,- neither Eileamon nor Eiber
is mentioned there—one of the many proofs.

in my opinion, of the great antiquity of the
principal part of that poem. The topogra-
phical argument, founded on the localities
occupied by the four tribes in the earliest

ages, has been already applied (p. 461,

note Ρ, supr-d) to the Irian *bl-anch, and,

perhaps, when applied to the other three
