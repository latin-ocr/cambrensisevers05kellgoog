appears that it was not merely one „ailant Giruldus hed, end against
one pert of his work, namely‚ the second distinction, but that the whole
work was aeanfled and refuted by s. host of critice„ Moreover‚ as he does
not specify the· parts which are founded on report alone, I cannot see
how the whole work een be regarded otherwise than as a heap of fables,
(thy Gir-aldus is not ιο take his plaee among story-tenere? Such ap·

’ peers tohave been the opinion of Ware. ‘⁶ Giraldue cambrensis,” he says,

‘⁶ hes collected in his Topography many subulcus stories regarding Ire-
lmd3 'but we must leave the examinetion of them to othere, as the
subject would require a good volume‚” doc. ς’ and afterwards he adde,
‘⁶ that he is surprised how some men of the present ege, otherwise emi-
nent for prudence end learning, could again venture ιο present Giraldus’s
inventione to the world in the guise of history.’' 1 feel strongly inclined
ιο give a thorough refutetion of very many parte of the Topogrephyg
but it would be a useless labor, since we heve his own universal recen-
tation. We have only to congratulata the man on his not allowing his
guilt ιο weigh on his conscience, end· on his humble return from⁴ his
imprudent wandel-inge 'in the paths of error. His offence must be laid
to the account of the fmilty of human natm-03 his repentence was en
act of virtue. .

But hc stateo many things regurding our very remote history, which
he could neither see with his eyes, nor leern from othere, nor sanction
even with the poor authority of his favoritc popular reporta. The gos-
sipings of milon, oi· the vegue stories of the common mldiers, to which
he was ever ready to give so willing en ear, could supply him with no
glir'npse of those facts which he has recorded regerding our ancient his-
tory.- “ But, ales 1” he ories, ‘⁴ they hed been‚” before his own day “ either
utterly mexplored, or known only ιο a 'fem For the Irish world,
though not e perfectly maiden subject before him, was never before
fully exhibited ιο the world.” Νη, “ in the two first parts of the
Topography, he got no light whatsoever from Irish, booksd, none from
external eid, nothing but his own searching and diligent inquiry.” The
two first parts „ of the Topography were, therefore, a compound of his
own reveries and inquiries: the third! was taken from the public re-

ments still extant3 and, yet, though he of the ‘⁴ Mirabilia” of Irish saints, he could ¹
professes, in that second distinction, to treet find no written materials to aid his inquiry!
