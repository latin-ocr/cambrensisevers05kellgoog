but worthyof being held up to posterity as the most powerful motives
to virtue, and to a hatred of crime. Giraldus would have spent his time
more usefully in ornarnenting his pages by those brilliant deed8‚ than
in defiling them with vulgar storieS, collected with such perverted in-
dustry. ‘⁸ The noble deeds of Irish kings would encumber his abridg-
ment with excessivo prolixity32’ but space enough was reserved for
every blot in the character of the Irish peasant‚ as a means of calum·
niating the whole nation. The spider extracts poison, and the bee .
honey, from the thyme; so Giraldus has raked together whatever was
'’censui-able in the morals of all the Irish‚ to the total exclusion of their
noble qualities. His filthy stories were the “ pearlsstwhich h‘zss‘ culled ’²
and collected, and set as “ the fairest ornaments in his present volume ;’'
like the sow which revels more voluptuously when wallowing in the
mire, than when regaled with the most fragrant odoi-S. ⁶ I am not so
simple as to deny that every nation has its faults as well as its virtues;
nor could I have just grounds of complaint, if he had not totally sup-
pressed whatever was honorable‚ after having published whatever was

discreditable in Ireland„
