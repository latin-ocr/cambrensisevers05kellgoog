Mnredhachq‚ surnamed Tireach, having secured the crown by the A. D.
sword, received into favor the three Colles, after their three· years' exile {gs
in Alba, and allowed them, on their return to Ireland, to make war
against the Ultonians. Fortune favored them in several battles, by
which they conquered for themselves some districts in Clenna-Rury‘,
namely, Mughdorna³‚ Ui-Cremthainn‘, Ui-Mic-Uais¹²‚ and, in a word, all
the land about¹ Lough N eagh, the present county of Domi, and part of
Antrim. In the battle of Achadhleithdearg’‚ in Fearnmhagh, against
the ednas, the mtoniam 10st Pergus rogim, King· of maer, and son of
Fiachra Fortruin'‚ while the Colles lost their youngest brother, Meann.
After this battle the victorious Collas destroyed Emania⁸, the royal
palace of the Ulster finge, in which, thenceforward,· no king· of Ulster
dweltb. In the thirtieth year of his reign, Muredhach was slain at Port-

. Singular- that these Domnonians, who, ac-

cording to bar-dic story, had enjoyed the
province of Connaught more than 200 years

before the landing of Eireamoin, and, un-
interruptedly down to this >- present date,

should now be enlisted under Eireamonian
banners, to destroy their· follow-sufferas,
the lrians. So singular does it appear to
me, that I doubt whether those Domnonians
and other Firbolgs may not have been the
last race of invaders before the nane„ in
other words, that the conas themselves, and
