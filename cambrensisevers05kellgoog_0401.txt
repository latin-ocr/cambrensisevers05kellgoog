to his barii, Amergin Mac Auley, grandson of Moelruan, reciting a work
on the etymology¹ of the remarkable places in Ireland; as we read of
Augustae, “who listened, with patience and kindness, to recitatione
not only of poems and history, but also of orations and dialogues.”
The Emperor Claudius, also, sometimes assisted‚ even uninvited, at re-
citatione ς and if an auditory be a stimulant to exertion‚ study and
talent must have been fostcred and developed by such auditore. Domh-
naid, King of Ireland‚ spent the few intervals of leisure, snatched from
the fatigues of war and the ceres of state, in the study of history, end
in the society of those who were masters of that branch of knowledge.

But it is not in praising himself alone that Girsldus lifts his erest
to the stars. All his friends and countrymen get a liberal share of his
eulogy. He devotes to them many a false digressiom but he depresses
rather than exalte their character, though the grand object of his book
appears to be a panegyric on them, and not a history of the events which·
he hed intended to record. Take the following specimen on Robert
Fitzstephen‚ as one instance of the criminal lengths to which Giraldus
proceeds in his fulsome fiattery: “ O heroi thou unpassable model of
virtue and true constency‚ in the vicissitudes of thy chequered and
generally adverse destiny. O hercl who hast so often‚·both in Cambria
and Ireland‚ experienced with equanimity every point on the wheel,
enduring the heaviest visitatione of the worst‚ and enjoying the choicest
favors of the best fortune. Ο Fitzstephenl thou second Marius‚” &e
But some person may urge against me that one swellow does not make ·
a summer, nor one argument gain his cause for the advocate. My only
motive, however, for not entering‘ into a full detail of the prooss of
. Giraldus’s excessive partiality to his friendS, is the dread of fatiguing and
disgusting myself and my rendere. Hear how he extols Raymond to
the stare: ‘⁶ Any detachment commanded by him rarely or never mis-
carried through rashness or negligence. He was a modest and prudent .
man, choice neither in dress nor food‚ and patient both of heat and cold.
Master of his temper, and superior to fatigue‚ he always wished to be
rather the servant than the master, and to consult for the happiness
rather than to govern through the fears of those whom he commanded.
He was a m'an, mild, liberal, provident, and prudent,” 820. Sic. His
panegyric on Meyler is equally liberal: ‘⁶ He was a ‚courageous and
aspin-ing knight, who never shrunk from any enterprise that could be
