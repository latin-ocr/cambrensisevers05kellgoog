was not received in any of these counties during the reign of Eliza-
beth. For when William Fitzwilliam, the successor of Perrott, pro-
posed ιο send a sheriff into the county Fermanagh, to administer jus-
tice, Davis says that Maguire answered he would be most happy to
receive the sheriff, but that he wished ιο know the amount of his eric,

of the invaders could not die but by the
hands of the English. In 1232 Tyrone and
Tyroonnell are at feud‚ and Maurice Fitzge-
rald and the Earl of Ulster take hostages
from both in 12883 but the English nominee
in Tyrone was deposed 3 aud, in 1241, Briau
O'Neill and O’Donnell formed a league.
Fitzgerald defeated both chiessains in 124⁷;
slew 0·D0n‘neu; partitioned aymonnem m
resisoed immediately by⁸his own nominee,
O'Canannain‚ whom he deposed. He gave
the country to Godfrey O'Donnelh and took
hostages from O'Neill in 12483 but, in 1253,
O’Neill defeated the Iaord J ustice magen-dd
with , great daughter, and burned Dundalk ς
while, in 1257, Godfrcy O'Donnell met the
Lord J ustice in single combat at the battle
of Drumcliff, wounded him severely, de-
feated his army, and drove the Geraldines
from Leve: Connaught. Fitzgerald did not
survive this defeat. The first terrible blow
ιο the O'Neills was the battle of Down‚ in
1259 ; but the O'Donnells had more than
their former power down ιο the year'128l,
when Donnell og O'Donnell was defeated by
Tyrone and the Ulster English,—a defeat
which broke the power of both o’Nein and
O’Donnell. It is manifest from the prece-
ding sketch that, during 100 years aster the
invasion, there was no regular tribute from
these princes. But in 1286 they were
compelled ιὸ give hostages to the Red Earl
of Ulster3 and from that period to 1333 is
the lowest state of native power, when the
O'Neilla though often resisting‚ were driven

ω the boge and mountains of Tyrone (Re-¹

monstrantes os Dosa-ald O’Neill to Pops

John XX IL), and the O'Donnells were¹ .

awed by the great. castle of Inishowen‚
which was erected in 1305, and was in the
hands of the English dmm ιο 1332, at
least. 11· the King’s writ ran, or tribute was
regularly μία, in Tyrone or '1¹yroenndl, it
must have been only during that short pe-
riod, interrupoed, of oourse, by ὼε episbde
of Bruce's invasion. Τὴο Red Earl, accord·
ing to Dr. Lynch (p. [249] ), was great-
grandson, by the maternarum, of cathal
O’Conor Crobhdearg. A daughter of the
Earl was married toRobert Bruce, and ano-
ther to Maurice Fitzthomas--two power-ful
aliances. Some loose statements in modern
and respectable werke, rcgarding the power
of England in Ireland during the reign of
Hem-y 111. and the greater part of that
of Edward 1., will, it is hoped‚ excuse the
length of this note. The lrish, as Lord
