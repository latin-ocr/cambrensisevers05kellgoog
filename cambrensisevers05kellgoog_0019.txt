His antagonist had been ordered to quit Rome, and his work was
disowned by the superior of the religious order to which he had
- ,associated himself in Italy. The contest had thus lost much of its
interest. But Dr. Lynch gives full scope to his discursive humor,
ranging over every period of Irish history, and indulging in his
usual exuberance of classical allusion and illustration. Itis painful
to find him at times bearing so heavily on the memory of ,Eoghan
Ruadh O'Neill; but it must be remembered that stories of the
ferocity of the old Irish were probably nursery rhyrnes in Galway
when Dr. Lynch was a' child. The most significant, and indeed
unpardonable trait of partisanship is, that, while he condemns the
Ulster Irish‚ he appears altogether to forget the spoliatione which
goaded that noble race to desperate measures. His adversary
accused the Anglo-Irish, and with great reason, of having eo-
operated with the new English in the Parliament of 1613, in
confiscating the nine counties of Ulster. The charge is hardly
denied. That confiscation, on the principles of Dr Lyneh, should
have beeri regarded as t-he completion of the conquest of Ireland,
commenced 400 years before by his Anglo-Irish kindred. From
the days of Henry ΙΙ. to the ssight of the Earls of Tyrone and
Tyreonnell‚ the history of Ireland may be summed up in the words
of (ilfi-aldus, ‘⁶ Hiberniae regios. nostris majori ex parte nondum
habita vel efficaciter occupata est.”

In the same year he wrote a pathetie poem, in answer to the
question, “Why do you not aeome home to Ireland?” It is a.
mir-ror of his feelings in exile, and peculiarly interesting, because
it is the only work in which we see himself. He would not re-
turn, he sayS, because, broken down by age and infirmitieS‚ he
would be aburden to himself and others3 he could not bear to see
reduced to beggary those whose opulence and public spirit had
adorned his native town; he could not exchange the free altars

hiding places in [reland3 nor behold the churcheS, where he had
