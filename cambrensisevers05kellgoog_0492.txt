which confirma the doubt (p. 444, note ¹¹,
ηψπ-ὸ) on the partition of Ireland by Ugaiue
Mor. Pergus Cnai and Sanbhe, two sons
of Ugaine, figure iu that partition as sin-⁰
cestors os the two tribes of the Deisi--Oyy-
φά, p. 260. On the other hand, it might
be urged in favor of the antiquity and ge·
nsi-al accuracy of that partition, that it
includes no part, of Wexford, though the
Eiremonian Fotharts acquired possessionis
there in the third century.—Irish Neuius,

p. 254. The southern part of that county ’

appears in the earliest legendo to have been
held by the Tuatha Fibdgha, of British
origin, and different from the Rrbolg sub-
jecta of Crimthain Sciathbel, King of Lein-
stes-nia. pp. 123, 2543 but ιω Κεαεεηρ,
p. 307. ‘

¹³ Cathaoir was the last king of Ireland
of the Lagenian line (Oyyyia, p. 310), and
r‘eputed apcestor of most of the great fami-
lies of Leinsten-See his will, and the fol-
lowing poem, Book of Riyhts, p. 193, et
seq. The chief familias in ancient Leinster
not deseended from Ugaine Mor, ancestor
of Cathain appear to have been the Laighse
of Leix, the Forthuatha, or sti-anger tribes,

of Hy-Mail in Wicklows-Book os Riffu,
p. 207, and those mentioned in pag-es 471,
478, notes ¹⁸, ¹¹. Laighean, the Irish name of
the province, is derived from Guilean, one
of the Firbolg or Belgio tribes, by a trans-
position nof unusual in the Irish language,
and which probably explains how the γα-
λαται of the Greeks, and the Celtae of tho
Latius, became δαθῠιῑ, the Irish name ot
the Irish Celts. But of the origin of- that
name at another time. Keating cites an an-
cient poem on the alliance which existed
between Franco and the province of Lein-
ster, p. 355. Bran, the name of a leinster
king in the first century (Book οῙΙίῂΙιεε,
p. 36), is not unlike the Brennus of the
Latius and Greeks, that well-known and
dreaded tine of the Gaulish chiesa. In the
list of Leinster king-s published by Colgan
(Triae Thanna„ index), Bran occurs so
frequently that it appears to have been, like
the Brnide of the Picta or the Brenn of tha
Gauls and Brstons, a common name of all
the kings. .
