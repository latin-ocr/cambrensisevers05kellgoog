Tun suppression of truth is as grievous a fault' m a histor-ian, as the state·
ment of falsehood. For, as St. Augustine says,‘ ‘They who conceal the
truth,01· utter a lie, are both guilty. the former, because he wishes not
to do good3 the latter, because he desires to do evil. ” Boetius also
writes: “I do not think myself at liberty to violate the maxim of
Socrates, either to conceal the truth, or sanction a falsehood.” Suppres-
sion of truth ie, therefore, a crime in a historiam it was punished by
legal penaltieS‚ as Cicero assures us. Sallust was guilty of this offence
in his history of the conspiracy of Cataline. He hated Cicer0, and there-
fore suppressed many undoubted facte, because they reflected great honor
on Cicero. Thus, he takes no notice of the vote of thanks passed by
the Senate to Cicer0, nor of the title “ Father of his Country‚” nor of the
supplication decreed in his name, nor of the gilt statue erected to him
by the Decurions in Capua. Thucydides also offended in this way3 for,
in his eighth book, where he relates the attempt made by Antiphon,
the rhetorician, an eloquent man, to subvert the democracy of Athene,
he pasees over in silence the conspirator's fate, and does not tell us that

he was executess and hisbody exposed to be devoured by wild beasts.

This was an act of filial gratitude to Antiphon, who had been his master · ⁴

in the principles of eloquence. Therefore none but the wicked and un-⁸
principled would suppress whatever reflects glory on a nation σι· an
individual in the execution of virtuous and noble deeds. ,
Giraldus has omitted many things, which the nature of hi· subject
and his own express words should have obliged him to notice. David
Powel remarks, “ that Giraldus, when speaking of William de BraOS,
Lord of Brecon, either excuses or extenuates his crimeS‚ and delibe-
rately suppl-esses “some of them altogether. Thus he speaks in such a
way of his disloyalty to the King as to excuse or justify it; and after·
wards a history of some crime committed by the same De Braos is
totally omitted,’' with the exception of some circumstances introduced
with the design of throwing the blame of the‘treason and murder on
another person. He undertook to describe the immigrations of various
tribes to Ireland‚ and the principal facts of their history3 nay, he ,
even promised to treat of the primitive inhabitants of this land, and of
