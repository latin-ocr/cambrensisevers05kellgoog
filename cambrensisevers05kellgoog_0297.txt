conntyof Cork. O’h-Uidhrin makes O’Brea-
gha and O’Glaisin the chiese of this terri-
tory.

5 Now Dinneen and Downing, without
the prefix 0'.

¹ Unknown.

θ Now the barony of Kerrycurrihy, in
the coanty of Cork. O’Cuire is now un-
known. ¹ It is to be distinguished from
O'Gomhraidhe of Dal-gCais, which is an-
glicised Cory, carry, and Cowry. .

ὓ Ακρῖίοὲ O'Callaghan, lord of Kinelea,
now the barony of Kinelea, in the eounty
of Cork. This agrees with O'h-Uidhrin.
—Sec remarks in note ⁸, p. 267, supra,
where O'Ceallachain is erroneously made
iord of Ui-Eathach-Mumhan.

e This is correct here, though the same
name 'm introduced incorrectly twice before,
evidently from bad copies of O'h-Uidhrin's
poem-See note ², p. 268, supr&-

ἀ This agrees with O’h-Uidhrin's poem.
—See note ¹, p. 268, cupre). In the manu·-
script' account of Carbery, entitled, “ Gar-
brioe Notitia,” it is stated that the barony ef
Bau-ryme “ formerly belonged tothe O'Cow-

higa a sept of the O'Driscolls, from whom*

Downcowhig takes its narne.’'

θ This should be Ui-Bain, a family who
gave name to the' barony of Ibawne, in the
south of the county of Oork. They were
Uirrigha, or dynasta, ιο O'Cowhig.

t Now unknown.

8 This name is introduced now, for the
fourth time, evidently from different copies
of O'h- Uidhrin's poem. O’Floinn Arda was
dynast ιο O’Driscoll, and not to O'Cobh-
thaigh. “

¹¹ Now anylice Feehilly and Feely. The
celebrated Maurice de Portu O'Fihely, called
Flos Mundi, Archbishop of Tuam from 1506
to 1513, was of this family. He was born
near Baltimore, a town, as Hatris remarks,
⁹⁴ celebratedfor its fine harbour‚” from which
he was known as ‘⁴ de Portu.''-See Har-
ris’s edition of Ware's Bishops, p. 613. In
a carious account of ‘Corca-Luighdhe, or
O’Driscoll’s Country, preserved in the Book
of Lecan, f01.122‚ et seq„ and in 15. Mae ffir-
bisigh’s genealogica work, p. 677, Tuaen·-
O’Fithcheallaigh is described as extend-
ing from Gaibhlin-an-Gaithncamhna to the
island of Inis-duine, a'nd from Dua-Eo,
ghain to Glaise-Draighneacha.

ἱ Now probably disguised nnder the an-
glic-,ised form Dowdall.
