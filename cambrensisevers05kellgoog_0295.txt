O’Ciarmhaicb‚ lord of Eoghanaeht- Aine03 O’Cinnsaelaidh‚ lord of Ui-

O'Donnagain]‚ lord of Museraidhe-Maigheh3 O'Donghaile‚ lord of Deie-

O’Longarain [recte O'Lonnargain]‚ lord ofUi-Cuanach¹; O’Dubhagain,

Tire¹¹; O'Seagha, lord of Cerea-Duibhne⁰; O’Conchobhair, lord os Oiar-

quainted with him, as “ genere nobili oriun-
due?

¹ This is a mistake for O’Cuiue, lord of
Eoghanacht Aradln as in O‘h-Uidhrin's
topogmphictl poem.

ε This was one of the ancient names of
the barony of Clnnwillinm, in the south<
west of the county of 'Upper-ary. —- See
Book of fflqhts, p. 45. The family-name
O'Cuirc is still oommon in this territory,
and now always written Qufflx, without the
prefix O’.

Ι· This is a mistake for “O'Donnagain‚
lord of Muscraidhe-tfi-Maighe’· i. e. Mus-
kerry of the Three Plains. This territory,
which ναξ otherwise called Muekerry-‚Do-
' negan, is included in the present barony of
Barrymore, in the county of Cork. It was
granted by King John to Willi'am de Bal-ry.
.·.·...Ib., p. 45.

¹There ‘is some unaccountable mistake
⁸ here. O’h-Uidhrin places three familias in
Deis-Beag, whom he calls the heroes of
claim, namely, O'Lualsn O’Duibhmsa, and
O‘Faircheallaigh [O'Farrelly]‚ the laet of
whom was eeated at the hill of chire, near
Dunuyleague, in the county of Limeriok.
The territory of Deis-Beag lies between the
hill of Knockany and Sliabh Claire, in the
county of Limeriok, and contains the town
of Brugh-na-Deise, now the town of Bruff.
It maybe regarded as coextensive with the
barony of Sman (lonay-See Annals os

the Four Masters, Ed. J. o’D.‚ A. D. 1560,
p. 1580, note «¹, aad A. D. 1580, p. 1730,
note θ’.

⁸ This is a mistake f01-“ O'h-Anmchadha,
lord of Ui-Liathain.” The territory of Ui-
Liathain extended round Caislean-Ui-Lia-
thain, now Castle Lyonsq in the oounty of
eon-k, and eompr‘med the Island of Oilean-
mor - Arda - Neimhidh, now Bau-ymon
bland, near Cork. — See Book ‘ff Riyhts,
p. 72, note ⁸.

¹ Now the barony of Ooonagh‚ in the east
of the county of Limerick. The O’Lon5-
nargaine (now Lonnergans) were dispos-
eessed at an early period by a braneh of
the O'Briens of Thomond‚ who took the
eur-name of Mac Briau Cuanach.

This ie oon-eet, but misplaced here.
O’Dubhagain ie now anglicised Duggan.
This family, which descende from the cele-
brated Cuanna Mae Caelchine, the rival in
hospitality of Gmire AicIIme, King of Con-
naught, is now represented in the male line
by. the family of Cronin‚ of the puk, near
Killamey, in the county of Rem.

¹¹ This is a mistake for “O’Fuirg of Mus-
craidhe-Thire,'’ and ie out of plane here es
well as Pena—Maighe. The territory so
called anciently comprlsed the baronies of
Upper and Lower Ormond‚ in the county
of Tipperary.—8oe Book of Mylan, p. 29‚'
note θ.

⁰ This should be “ O’Seagha, lord οἰ
