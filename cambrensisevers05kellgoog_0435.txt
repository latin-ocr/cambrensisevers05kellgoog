the arrival and extinction of all the other colonies in succession3 yet he
has not one word on the expedition of the Tuatha de Dananns⁸, th'ough
they maintained for many years an ascendancy in Ireland, as will appear
from a list of the kings of Ireland during their occupatiori. 1 am not
charging him now with having omitted all mention of the good quali-
ties of the Irish, his object having been evidently to transmit their 'vices
to posterity3 but what opinion, I ask, are we to have of a man who
violatos his express promise, and does not say one word on subjecte
which he had promised to relate in detail? ‘⁸ The third part of my
Topography,” he says, “contains a record of all the remarkable events
os Irish history, from the earliest origin of the Irish people to the pre·
sent day.” v
‘⁸ So grand a promise how does hs redeem ἲ ”

By nothing, in truth, worth notice. If a man promises to expound the
principles of any art, and omits touching even lightly on its simplest
rudiments, his work is exploded3 and yet Giraldus, after promising to
give not only a history of Ireland, but the whole history of Ireland‚

space for matters intimately connected with his subject, though he
sedulously scraped together heaps of extraneous trash. That he did sc, ·

dence of the little influence which common sense, or a desire of throwing
light on. the affairs of Ireland, ever had on the mind of GiralduS.

We might bear patiently his omission of the names of the Irish
king-s, if he had refrained from stigmatizing their reigns3 but n0,--“ he
found,’' he says, ‘⁶ very little that was remarkable or worthy of notice.”
In another place I shall vindicate the character of the Irish kingS, some
of whom were eminent for their wise administration, many for their
fame and power in war, some for learning, and a very great number for
