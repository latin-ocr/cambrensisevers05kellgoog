Barnabas Rich very properly declat-ed “ that he was not such an enemy
to the prosperity of Irishmen as to advise them to conform to all Eng-
lish fashions. Hardly can you find a single carrier going from chester to
Dublin who does not import different fashions of dress, both sor men
and for women, from England. The Irish are proud and enthusiastic,
but they are not fickle enough to accommodate themselves rashly to
every whim of fashion'.”

Ι never heard that Rome compelled by law any of her conquered
provinces to abandon their own dress, or to adopt her own. For the
Romans were distinguished from all other nations by the toga. To this

the lines of the poet allude:
“ O'er the wide world the Roman toga reigns.''

Exiles were certainly prohibited to wear the toga, in order to deprive
them not only of their country, but of every mark by which they could be
recognised as Romans Once expunged from the roll of Roman citizen-
ship, they were, in a manner, condemned to adopt the dress of the barba-
risns to whose country they were banished. Scipio, as we learn from
Livy, was censured for having appeared in the gymnasium with cloak
and sandals3 Cicero charged Verres with' having worn, while praetor,
sandala and a purple pallium, and, in his Philippica, he accuses some
judges of using the pallium and toga indiscriminately‚ as if the use of the
ordinary dress of the Greeks, instead of the Roman toga, were a degene-
rate adoption of Grecian customs. Different kinds of plays even had
their distinctive names from the ornaments and dress worn by the
players. The Grecian were called ‘⁴ palliatae,” from the dress of that
nation; the Roman “ togatae.” Thus the toga was a distinctive mark

, of every Roman citizen. Other nations were persuaded rather than

compelled to adopt it. Thus, as Tacitus observeS, ‘⁶ the Roman dress
was considered respectable by the Britons and the toga was generally
worn by them.” But who has ever heard that the Greeks were pre-
vented from wearing their pallium and casiaca, or the Sardinians their

osten killed, being mistaken for Irishmen‚ degradation to the level of mere Irlshmen.
