good ; and the prej udices of some of the most intolerant of the ascen·
dant party were gradually yielding before the sostening influence of
common literary tastcs. Everything promised the speedy adjust-
ment of confficting pretensions. That fond dream,—the union of
Irishmen on grounds of perfect equality in every respect, reli gious
and political, for the national good,—should soon become a reality. ο
These were the views of Dr. Lynch, the hopes which, he believed,
were blasted by the rashness of the Ulster Irish, the rapacity of
Irish land speculatore, and the complications οξ English politics,
all which precipitated the catastrophe of 1641.

’ The Catholic Consederation of 1642, he* maintained, was de-
fensible as the only means of sels-defence against the open enmity
of the Lords J usticeS, Borlase and Parsons, the deep laid schemes

of a hoary adept in confiscationb‚ and the fanaticism of the extreme ·

English party, which maintained, even prior to the Consederation, '
tliat the extirpation of Catholics was indispensable for the “ settle· ⁶
ment” of Ireland. Of course, Dr. Lynch defends the cessation of
1643, the peace of 1646 and 1648, condemns the N unci0‚ approves
the general policy of Ormonde, on the ground that these measures
were indispensable for loyalty to the English Orown, and for the
safety of the Irish Catholics. Hc even praises the Catholic Earl
of Clanrickarde, for having never joined the confederation. In
general, his opinions agree with those of David Rothe, wh0, it
was commonly believed, had drawn up the plan of the supreme
council of the ConfederateS.

On the surrender of Galway in 1652, Dr. Lynch fied to F rauce,
one of'those fugitives whom he describes so feelingly in this work,
as scattered to the‘four winds of heaven by the English PuritanS.
The particular-s of his life in exile are unknown. But as some of
his works were printed at St. Malo's, we may infer that he had taken

refuge on the borders of Brittany, where the States allotted public
support to the Irish exiles, His kinsman, Andrew Lynch, Bishop
of Kilfenora, resided at St. Malo’s, and was visited there in 1661
