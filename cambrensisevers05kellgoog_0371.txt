history, by the testimony of⁴ no less an oracle than the tripod of Mer-.
linm 1—but the more vehemently he insiste on such an authority, the
greater our contempt for him. For what could be expected from the.
son of an incubus · but deception, vanity‚ and lies? Can the history
stand which rests onssuch an oracle? ⁵ What but hopeless i'ailure can
be the lot of a work, planned under the inspiration of an imp begotten
of the father of lies? What but deformity could be expected in the
superstructure dedicated to such a Lesbia? .
Giraldus's authorities are drawn from an inauspicious source, a
fountain infected with the poison of lies. The river must retain the
taint os the fountain from which it springs· Now Merlin's books have
been objects of general ridicule, contempt, and execration. They are.
on the Index of works forbidden to Catholics¹²; and yet he, not only a
catholic, but a respectable theologiam did not hesitate to pore over-
their contente, and give them the authority of his name. Many pas-
sages in his works are—I will not say ornamented, but-defiled with
an ill-odored wreath of extracta culled from Merlin, which he has
strained -his ingenuity to distort, by “ interpretatione,” into wrong
meanings. He has thus labored to give respectability to works which
he should rather have consigned to the flames, had he not preferred in-
dulging the rash propensities of his own judgment to the example of
those who had “followed curicus arte, [but] brought together their
books and burned thern before all.” If he saved Merlin from the flamae,
ought not his own books be consigned to the fire? Is the poison inno·
cuous because Giraldus’s pages are impregnated with it? It were well
for him that he had followed the example of the magician who was con-
verted by St. Augustin‚ “and who brought those books to be burned,
which would have burnedhimself, that by committing them to the
fire, he might secure a place of rest for himselfl'’ I't was fortunate for
Giraldus vthat he did not live in the reign of Vitellius. It is not his
books only, but his life that would be in danger, had he evinced such
partiality for the sorceries of magicians; for Vitellius bore so mortal a
hatred to soothsayers and mathematicianS, that not one of them, when

ing to white, have shared the same fate. sacrae Inquisitionis in Italia aut Hispania,
