of Irish character are the spawn of that English barbarism, which, in
former times, hunted the natives from the walks of civilized man to
savage lurking-places⁰‚ and, in those days, would dragoon them into
heresy from the Catholic saith. As well might you attribute to Eng-
lish missionaries that Catholic faith which, in those modern times, is

growth of the Irish soil. The author of the Analecta justly ridiculed
those who asserted, “ that if the Irish nation had anything worthy of
praise or honor, any decency or virtue, any genius, mental culture, or
civilization, any refinemenh renown‚ or glory; all was to be attributed
to English government and influence.” He assigns the grounds of his
