. ² The two Corca-Bhaiscinns. These ter-
ritories still· retain their names. Corca·
Bhaiscinn, Eastf is now considered to be
co-extensive with the present‘ barony of
Clonderalaw, and Corca-Bhaiscinn, West,
with the adjoining barony of Moyarta, in
the county of Clare· But it appears from the

Life of St. Senanu3‚ and many other ancient ‘

authorities, that previously to the settlement
of the M ac Gorm‘ans, or O’Gormans‚ in ,the
barony of Ibrickan‚ the country of the Cor-
ca- Bhaiscinn compr-ised that barony also.
‚ ὓ Now O’Donnell', a name still entant in
these territories. The name O’Bais'cinn is
obsoleto. „ ·

'¹ Now O’Kennedy. According to O'h-

, Uidhrin‚ this family was originally seated

in Gleann- Omra, or parish of Cill Q gCin·
neide, anylice Killo- -Kennedy, in the east
of the county of clare3 but they afterwaxua
settled in Ormond, in the county of Tippe-
rary. The 0’ Kennedys of this raoe are all
reduced to poverty and obscurity.
eThis was the ancient name of the baro-
niee of Upper and Lower Ormond, in the
‘ county of Tipperary. O’Domghalie, now
ι O’Donnelly‚ and O'Fuirg,· now obsoleta
were the chieftains of this territory before
the O’Kennedys. ¹
‘¹ More correctly Coro-Meadhruaidh, i. e.
the race or progeuy of Meadhruaidh3 now
the ‘barony of Corcomroe, in the west of the
county of Clare. The family of O'Con·

'of Clare, where the “

chobhair, or O'‘Conor‚ of this racc, are all
reduced to poverty and obscurity.

θ This was the ancient name of the ba-
rony of Burren, in the north of the county
Abbey of Corcomroe ‘⁷ '
still preserves the name. The O’Lough-
lina of this mee, aa well aa the O’Go-
nors, are descended from Meadhruadh, fifth
in descent from Fearghus or Fergus Mac
Roigh‚ ex-King of Ulater in the first cen-
tury. Lochlainm the anceator from whom
they took the sumame -O’Lochlainn, died
in the year 983. From his brother, Con-
chobhar‚ are descended the O’Conchobh-
aira, or O'Conora, of West Corcomroe. The

-O'Lochlainns, or O’Loughlins, are now re-

presented by O’Loughlin Burren fif-Now-
town, in the barony of Rauen, and sir
Colman o’Loughlen,Ba1-t. ⁸

f This, which was the tribe- name os the
,θ’ Deae, was also applied to their territory,
which comprised the greater portion of the
barony of Inchiquin, in the oounty of Clare.
The O'Deaa of this racc are very numerous.
but all reduced to poverty and obscurity.

Ι That is, the race of Iffearnan. This
was the tribe-name of the Ui·Cuinn or
o’QuinQ whose territory was ‚included in
the present barony of Inchiquin‚ and con-
tained the lake of Inia·Ui·Chuinn, that is,
O’Quin’s island, anylice Inchiquin‚ and the
district lying round the' village of Cora-fine,
now Corofin. This family is now represented
