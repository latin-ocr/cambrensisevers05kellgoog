Another motiva too, Ι had in undertaking this laborious task. When
the ‘chariot is to run with greater celerity, every obstacle that might
encumber or obstruet its passage is cautiously removed from the course;
so, by disposing here of all contested points„ the path may be cleared
for treading with more secure step the almost trackless field of Irish
history, and following without hesitation the course of its narrative.

If, in censui-ing Giraldus, I-appear too severe, it is from that instinct
of nature which compels the bee to use* its sting in aelf-defence¹; and if
any person should confi-ont me with the argument from Scripture, ‘⁴ Woe
to him through whom scandal cometh :²²1 appeal securely to the words
of St. Bernard: “ When vices are censured, and scandal thence arises,
the man who committed the censurable acts is the cause of the scandal,
and not he who condemns them.” , ’

The following is the plan of this work. After a few preliminary
observatione, Ι prove that Giraldus has not the qualities of a good histo-
rian; then 1 dispose of the faults which he finds in the Irish soil and cli-
mate3 next, I rebut his calumnious charges against the Irish people‚
princes, and kings3 afterwards, I answer his licentious invective against
our prelatas and elergy; finally, since heaven itself was no asylum
against his tongue, I follow him, and examine his blasphemous ussaults
on our Irish saints. This order, however, is not invariably observed.
Into whatever wilds or thickets his rambling and repeated digressions
stray, thither my pen turns and pursues him. The pilot does not always
keep the helm straight for the intended track, but often humors the
tide, and often bends his sails for whatever port wind and weather may
permit, in the hope of thence making the destined port. I must en-
deavour to imitate the prudent helmsman ς and should 'you'find any-
thing out of its place, remember that Ι am in pursuit of an antagonist
through tracklesswilds and bywayS.
