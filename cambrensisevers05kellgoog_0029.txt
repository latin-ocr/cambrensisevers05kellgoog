They 6116161111, 01 truly, ‘⁶ this is the change of ‚the right hand of the
Most High‚” certainly “ this is the finger of God.” “ 'th Lord hath
disgraced the assemblies of the wicked‚ and hath utterly destroyed
them. God hath overturned the thrones of proud princes, and hath set
up the meek in their stead.’' He has arisen as an avenger, and with a.
rod of iron broken in pieces‚ as a potter's vessel, those who stood up
against the Lord and his ancinted, and desired to cast away their yoke.
He 1166 struck the arms from the hands and fury from the hearts of the
enemies, and made them surrender the power of life and death over
themselves into the hands of him, whom, but a short time before, they
stra'ined all their power to deprive os his crown and his lif03 him whom
they regarded as their most desdly enemy, they efterwards selected as

of your subjecte, a more glorious victory than in the slaughter of your
enemies, and increasing, to the highest degree, the universal joy for
this peace, which has been established, not by the dismal havoc of' the
battle field, but by the unanimous and cordia] assent of your subjectS,
casting themselves before your throne, and giving you a victory with-
out a battle, and a triumph without blood. We have most heartily ,
