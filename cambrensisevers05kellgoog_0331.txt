or useless weedsr, Stanihurst wrote in a clear and ornate style, what
the other had obscured by his sordid and muddy diction. Robert
Turner‚ a first-rate orator, thus addresses Stanihurst: ‘⁶ The two
goddesses have lent you their hues: «Iunc, sweetness; Minerva, elo-
quenee. ' You have alighted upon this orb with such beauty, or rather
favor, 111 1110 eyes and ears of men, that you are pronounced a Demos-
thenes, not by the old woman of Athens merely, but by those 10 whom ,
011 1108 given eloquence, and nature the keenest perception. You have
taken your place among the crowned votaries of the pleasant and the
more recondite muse; you walk with the Scaligers,” (ize. &c. Now, in
the opinion of this Stanihurst·, the best that 0011 110 said of Giraldus is,

that he “ rather eschewed the name of a rude writer than purchased the .

fame of an eloquent chronicler. '²

I reserve‚ for a more favorable opportunity, the v 0110118 parts of Gi-
raldus' s two workS, which· were severely criticised by Stanihurst. The
instances are very numerous. Here 18 0110 proof of their disagreement.
Giraldus extols Irish music; Stanihurst appears to dispraise it. The
former writes: “ It is in musical instrumente alone} that the industry
of this 11011011 1108 0110111οᾶ 0 laudable degree of refinement, surpassing
immeasurably the skill of all other nationsu. Bold and rapid, yet sweet
and agreeable, the notes of the Irish harp are quite unlike the slow and
drawlingw melody of 1110 British instrumente, to which we are accus·
tomed. It is amazing how correct musical time can be observed in 80
bold and hurried sweeping of the fingers3 and how, amid all those

former the inharmonic genus, full of minute
divisions, with every diesis marked ς the
succession of the melodies lively and rapid,

hardly be 1000ῃέ11οᾱ with another 111 chap-
ter xi. of the Description of Wala, in
which Gir-aldus describes the Welsh music
as “lively and rapid,” and appears to for·-

get “ the slow and solemn ” character which.

he had attributed to it in his Topography
of lreland: ‘⁴ In musicis instrumentis dul-

oedine aures deliniunt et demulcent, tanta

breviter transeam in tribus nationibus titulo,
de musicis instrumentis, Hibemica Topo-
graphia nostra declarat in haec verba.”.-.
Descriptio, 8ιο.. cap. xi. He then tran-
scribes his celebrated passage on Irish mu—
sic, as the best description he could give of
the Welsh, and thus confounds the supposed
characteristics of both. Here, as elsewhere,
he contradicts himself. It is fortunate that
the ancient superiority of Irish music does·
not depe-nd on his authority alone.
