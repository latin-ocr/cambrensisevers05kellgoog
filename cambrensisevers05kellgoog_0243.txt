When colonies were planted by Rome, not more than a seventh of
the lands was taken from the natives and conferred on the· colonists.
The laws of the 'colony' were ei‘ther adopted from the Roman people‚ or
enacted by the colonial senate and democracy, according to the peculiar
character of the people amongst whom the colony was planted. Chris-
tian states carried out these sonnd principles of Roman colonizationss
When the Portuguese had conquered the East Indies‚ and planted colo-.
nias, they won the affectione of the natives to such a degree, by inter· ’
marriages and other social ties, that India gladly submitted to e foreign
sceptus, became one people with her conquerors‚ and willingly embraced
« their laws.

The CastiIians were equally fortunate' ln the West Indies. They inter-
married with the natives‚ and gave them the rights of Spanish citizen:-
ship. Justly, therefore, does Davis complain: “This Ι note as a great
defect in the civil policy of this kingdom, in that, for the space of three
hundred and fifty years, at least, after the conquest first attempted, the
English lawe were not communicated to the Irish, nor the benefit and
protection thereos allowed unto them. For as long as they were out of
the protection of the law, so as every Englishman might oppress, spoil‚
and kill them without control¹¹‚ how was it possible they should be other
than outlaws and enemies to the crown of England? If the King would
not admit them ’to the condition of subjecte, how could they learn to
acknowledge and obey him as their sovereign? When they might not
enter into any town or city¹ without peril of their lives, whither should
they fly but into the mountains and wood8, and there live in a wild and
barbarous manneffss’ ι

Contempt on those English writerS, who shamelessly attempt ,to fool
their readers into the belief that Irish civilization was derived exclusively
from Erigland. They may write the cheat in their books, and register

Irish princes or the English lurda, but eon· among the native Itish. —· Fom- Manere,
