¹ Labhraidh is the moond King of Tam
mentioned by Tighernach‚ A. C. 89, 632-
Rer. Hib. vol. ii. p. 6. “Cluen R15h

kings over Irdand, from Labraidh Loing·
seach to Cathaoir morl* Thnt is, there
were thirty Lagenian monarche of Ireland.
But Dr. O’Gonor (Rer- Hit. vol. ii. ps 6,
note) understands the passage as reeord-

ing that they were only petty kings of

part of Iaeinster. The former is the literal
meaning. Ι Yet our⁷ author allows thirty-
eight kings of kalend, from Lubhraidh to
Cethmir Mor, both included, of whom
twenty-five were Eiremonians, end only
eight Laganiam— 0999. p. 420. However
this may be, all the sucoeeding Eiremonians
were deseended from Hugony‚ and hence
the importunae given to him by the harde,
who, probably, attributed to him the pan—

tition of all the terrigenos subsequently ae-
quit-ed by his descendants. After the reign
of Hugaine, the monna-chy is gradually be-
coming the exclusive property of the Eire-
moniam. Thus, of thirty-nine kings who
preceded him, font-um were Iriane, and fif-
teen Eiberimsg but, of his thirty-eight im-
mediate successore, more than two-thinis
were of his family. The fact involved in
these myths appears to be the growing
aseendenoy of that rane (whatever it was)
which the bards have personified in Eiro-
mon and Ugaine.
