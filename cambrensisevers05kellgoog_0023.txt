INTBODUCTION. XV

The marginal headings of the original are collected at the head of
each chapter, the topics discussed being so variOuS, that it was
deemed useful to have the substance of the chapters indicated in
some compendious form.

Many of the opinions advanced in the Appendix, and some
of the notes on the eighth chapter, may appear novel, but it is
hoped that the errors, if any, are wrong conclusione from saith·
fully cited authorities, The Pagan history of Ireland is an open
field for speculation, if speculation condescend to tread upon solid
ground. We need not agree with the schools represented by
O’Flaherty, or Ware, orVallancey, or Pinkerton and InneS. O’Fla-
· herty. adopts as history the poetry of the bards; Ware rejects the
whole pagan story as an inextricable tissue of sable3 Vallancey
would prove, by etymology and conjecture, that we were the
Egypt of the western world; Pinkerton and Innes, with some
truth, blend more prejudice and insolence. But least of all are
the notes intended to countenance the vulgar assumption that

· Ireland owes her first fame to English connexion. Such a not-ion

deserves but silent pity or contempt, except when prudence de-
mands that the fool be answered according to his folly‚’ or other-
wise, as occasion may require. If the notes be in any way useful
to the honest and intelligent school of living antiquarianS, in eli-
citing the facts ‘which may be invdved in the copious records
of pagan story, and arranging Irish epoche in harmony with the
known contemporary revolutione in Brit-ain and on the Continent,
they have obtained their end. The whole work, amounting to
382 pageS, was translated before November, 1847, when many
sheets of the present volume had not been printed. Some of the
notes were planned to economize space in the subsequent volumes ;

othere, especially at page 235, were indispensable. From Chap- ,

ter IX. our author must speak for himself. All those who have
toiled at our history know the spirit in which, at the close of his
Preface to Keating‚ he quoted St. J erome, “ carpere ct detrahere
vel imperiti possunt, doctorum est, et qui laborantium novere su-
dorem, vel lassis manum porrigere, vel errantibus iter ostendere.’'
