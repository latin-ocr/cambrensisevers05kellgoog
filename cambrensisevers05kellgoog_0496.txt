p. 435, supr-d) Niebuhr's opinion, founded
on the scattered position of the 00118 111
Spain, that they *were not, as Thierry be-
lieved, invaders of that country, but rather
were invaded by the Iberians‚ who drove
them to the western shores, crossed the
Pyrenees, 81111, pushed their conquesta to
the banks of the Garonne‚ where they were
found by Caesar. As both opinions admit
the existence of 00118 111 Spain at a very
early period, they do not contradict 80 far
the tradition of a Spanish colony in Ire-
land. Niebhur's would ⁴rather favor 811011

invasions. But 1 cannot discover, either in

conjecturing the true history of the tribe.
