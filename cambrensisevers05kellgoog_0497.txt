Lughaidh‚ who was surnamed Maeoonns. After the death of her first
husband, she mirried Olill Olum¹, King ‘of Munster, by whom she had
nine children. But the stepson os Olill, being banished by his father, sue⁶
needed in enlisting the support of the people dmong whom he lived, and
returned with a power-ful army of foreigners to Ireland. Declaring war
against his uncle, Arthur‚ and his stepbrothers, the sons of 01i11·‚ he met
them on the field of Magh-Mueruimhe, and gained a decisive victory.
His seven brothers were slain in the battle, and Arthur himself fell by
the hand of Liguirne, son to Eochoidh Balbus, and grandson to Eoehoidh
Fionfuatha, who had followed Lugaidh into exile, A. D. 195, A. M. 5394.

After this fortunate engagement at Magh-Muornimhffi Lughaidhb,

preserved in its purity the Fenian (i. e.
Phoenician) lang-nge, and quotes a passage
from the Stowe manuscripts, in which the
prerogative of Cork is ‘⁸ Bearla Feine Erend
&magma-the ‘⁴ Fenian langunge of Ire·
land in Cork ;'' but, with all due respect for
the zeel and prodigal erudition with which
the learned writer endeavoured in vain to
work ont the timid conjecture of O’Fla-
herty (Oyyy., p. 22 l),Bearla Feine is not ex·
plained “ Phoeniciau language” by any na·

’ tive Irish authority 3 it is the dialect of the

Irish in thch the Brehon lawe are written.
In the modern Irish langnge, Feine is ap·
plied to the Irish militia of Fingal in the
third century. Ireland was also called
Pumlb, i. e. Hesperia (Battle of Maqh
Rath, p. 202), and its inhabitants “Feine,”
end their lawe Ὸῑιδὴῡθ nu Peme, from
the old lenguege in which the lawe were
written. — Petrie’s Tam, p. 55. But if
Feine were the same as Phoenician, is it not
strange that the bai-ds, who were so elever in
incorporating with their own history, facts
from the scripturos and profane writers,

have never interpreted Feine as Phoenician?

From the specimen of the Bearla Feine given -

in ΜΓ. Hardiman's Irish Mimtrelaey, vol. ii.
pp. 286, 429, it differed from the common
Irish as Dryden differs from Spenser, or aa
the old language of the Irish martyrologies
«Effer from the glosses appended to them in

‘the course of ages.
