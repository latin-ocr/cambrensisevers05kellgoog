8 This statement cannot be reconciled
with ancient authofities.--See infr-cl, note ί,
p. 424. Perhaps there is question only of
a peculial· form of idolatry introduced by

Tigernmas.
h,This was the idol called Crom Cruach,

' i. e. a “ stone, the top of which was covered

with gold, with twelve other stones stand-
ing around'it. ‘ It was the God ofall the
viations that ever possessed helmaci, down
to the arrival of St. Patr-iek.' To it they
sacrificed the first-born of every animal,
and[?] their first-born children. 'sigernmaa
with the men and women of Ireland, adored
it by wounding their bodies-and faces, and
hence the place was called ‘ Magh Sleachg'
i. e. the field of slaughter.”- Dinnsean-
chus, apud 0’ Οοπον, Proleq. pars i. p. xxii.
Another favorite idol of the northern Irish
was a stone called ‘⁴ clochoir,” or the golden·
stone (whence the name ‘⁶ Clogher”)‚ which
was kept even in Christian times inside the
porch of the church of Clogher. Its pagan
name was Keannand Kelstach. 0999. p. 1 97.
