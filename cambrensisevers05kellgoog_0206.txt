Facetias, quidem, scommata et sales paucis verbis complectitur, et in

liber Urikeacht⁶ inscriptus in es praescribat: ita ut poetae, metri Hiber-
nici varietate, artificio et argutiis, nulli aliarum Europae nationum poesi,
eorum qui plurium linguarum notitia instructi sunt judicio, non ce-
dant⁷. Quod non modice Spenserus corroborare mihi videtur, dicens:
“ Aliqua poemata Hibernica curavi mihi ab interprete exprimi, ut illa
perciperem, in quibus profecto multum acuminis, suavitati8‚ et bonae
inventionis inesse deprehendi3 fuerunt etiam aspersa singularibus qui·

8 Stanihurst published his Latin annota-
tions on Giraldus after retii-ing to Belgium
in 1584. In that work he modifies con-
siderably many of the opinions of his “ Eng-
lish description of Imm& publishod in
1575, but yet exhibits, in his new views
of Irish affairs, a piteous struggle between
the feelings of the 'old English Pales-man,
once the pet of English power, and those of
the Anglo-Irish catholic, who, as well as
the mere hish, was henceforward to feel
that power as a persecutor. ’

attributes the 'work to' a Fon-chem, who
lived in the fifth century: “ De Fortcherni

AEtate et de Arte Rhythmicii Hiberno-
rum” (Proleyomcna, Pars. 2⁶⁸, p. lxvii),
where he says that the Irish had, at least
from the earliest ages of Christianity, a
system of metrica! rules, and that from
them it was bon-owed by the Anglo-Saxou
Adelhm, 'p. lxviii. For the rulae of Irish
prosody see O’Mulloy's Irim Grammar,
p. 144, and O'Donovan’s, p. 412. on this
subject Gir-aldus exhibits his usual igno-
rance. Describing the Welsh poets and
rhetor-iciam, he says that they, as well as
the Anglo-Saxons, delighted beyond wea-
sure in that figure which he calls “anno-
minatio,” and especially that kind which
combined words whose first letters or gyl-
lables were similar: “ Prae cuncti· autem
Rhetorices exornationibus annominatione
magis utuntur, eaque principue specie quae
primas dictionum literas vel syllabas conve-
nientia jungat.” So highly was this figure
pflzed, that nothing was good without it.
“ Quod schematis hujus lima non fuerit
plene expolitum.” He is ainazed that so
