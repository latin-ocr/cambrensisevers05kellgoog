-The means for arriving at an accurate conclusion on that point shall
be pointed out in the sequel. But J ocelin embraced every opportunity
of exalting the glory of his own nation, and therefore national vanity is
supposed to have been the sole motive of· his narrative, in that twenty·-
ninth chapter, of an event not recorded in any other Life of sepau-ich.
He often records other events not mentioned by any biographer of St.
Patrick‚ and hence his authority is at tlie present day of slight weight
on some points. The chapters unx„ Lxx„ and Lxxr„ are of that cha-
racter. Thus, in chap. Lxxx„ he calls Dublin a little village3 and in
chap. Μαι, a noble city¹. The name he derives from the virgin Dub-
linia, and not from the Irish word Dubh-linn‚ signifying the black
pool⁷. In cliap. cnxxv„ he erroneously makes Gurmund and Turge-
sius Kings of Ireland⁸. These examples prove that Jocelin’s assertion
is not entitled to credit, when, without the authority of any other
writer, he assei-ts that Man or Mona formerly belonged to Britain.

“ Buadan, King of Ulster, who died A. D. 580, expelled the fo-
reigners from Man, and from that time forward Man was subject to
the Ultonians⁸.” But that historical fact does not support J ocelin's
position; because the Irish word ‘⁴ Gall,” used by O’Dugan‚ desig·
nates not a Briton‚ but an Angle or Saxon, a Dane, or any other
foreigner. They must have been Angles or Scirone whom Buadan
expelled, the Danes having made* no descent on Ireland before the
year 812, in which “ the Danish fleet,⁷ having invaded Ireland, was

was elain in that expedition. A poem, in the “ Even Ι who have come from sky,
Book of Leman (fol. 139, a, a), for which Ι have come twice and three times,

Dun Baedain, the seat of Mac Cain-ill. One
of them is thus introduced, lamenting that

his tribute was not more priami:
