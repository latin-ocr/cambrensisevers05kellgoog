in the entire course of that river between Connaught and Munster, there
is but one lske, Loch Derg, a large sheet of water above Killaios, end
nothing cen be further from the truth than that that lake is the source
of the Shennon. camden is much more correct, and the thing itself is
evident: ‘⁴ The Shannon,” he says, “ the king of Irish rivers, which
divides Menth from Connaught, was called by Ptolemy ‘ Senus,’ by ι
Orosius ⁸ sena) sud, in some copies, ‘ Saecanass by Girsldus ⁴ Senensess
but by the natives ⁴ Shannon,’ which some' interpret ⁶ the old river.’
It rises in the mountain of Tberne‚ in the county ot' Leitrim, end,
flowing southwards, sometimes expande into lakes, sometimes contracte
its bed, till, having thus formed one or two lakes, it becomes narrow at
the point- where it washes Macolicum (the Male ‘of Ptolemy, as G,
Mercator, the learned geographer, observes); and immediately after-
wards forms a spacious lake, called Loch Regith, near which, ‚as the
name and geographical position appear to indicate, stood Ptolemy’s
city of Rigia. Issuing from that lake, it flows through a narrow chan-
nel, where it weters Athlone. Having passed the falls of Killeloe, it is
navigable for ships of the largest burden at Limeriek, where its wetere
divide and surround the city. Thence, rolling its broad and rapid
waters westward, through a channel studded with islandS, it falls

their outlet to the sea. This, however, is
not the case3 for the oldest name of the
river Eme was Samum, and beni. acu
Secum& (Os Vadi Senachi) was merely
the name of the ford opposite which the
castle Ballyshannon was builtfl—J. O’D.
Possibly Giraldus may have heard of Lough
Hoyle [Loch Uair] in Westmeath, from
which two rivers issue in opposite direc-
· tions, the Brosns, which flows southward
into the King's County, and “ a short and
rapid stream which runs westward into
Lough Iron, which discharges its wetere by
the Inny into the Shannon ” (Beausort’s
Memoir, p. 64), and, dombining that fac-t
with another, ‘⁴ that Lough Clean[Allen], the

source of the shannon, is within four miles
of the river Bepnet [Buanait], ‘⁴ which car—
rIes boats into Lough Gilly, and thence to
Sligo Bay” (idem, p. 70), he may have
metamorphosed the Shannon into a medi·
terranean river. But great as this error of
Giraldus is, the reader must bear in mind
that, even inCamden’s Map of Ireland, the
northern coast, from the extreme poin'ts of
Antrim and Donegal, is a straight line3
that the western shore, from Tor-y Island to
Clare, is, with the exception of a very slight
projection (for Connaught), s straight line;
that the north—western corner of Donegal
is a rectaugle ; and that the present Donegal
is as large as all Connaught. The progress
of ,English knowledge on Irish affairs is
always slow.
