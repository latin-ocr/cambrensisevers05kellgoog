will not contradict the view here given o!
’ the truth involvedin the Milesian genealo-
gy. For to ne it appears, that if four diffe-
rent colonies lauded, and rose successively to
aeoendancy in Ireland, they would be found
in thc very places where history shows to
us the hians, Rhium, Eiberians‚ aud Eirea-
monians, located in the earliest period ofau-

thentic history. The reader may consult .

on the AEnotfians, for the use made of ge-
neaological tables, by that sceptical but
acute writer, in ascertaining the primitive
population of Italy. Thierry also employs
it, but with more prudence: “ Eniin nous
retrouvons les memes {dees de parente ex-

primees dans ces vieilles rables greco-tyrien-
nes qui rappellent les genealogies des Hc-
breux, et cachent souvent comme elles, un
sens ethnologique profondz elles nous par-

fine, nominee tantot Celtine, tantot Celto,

The reader must easily understand that the
authority of the genealogical tables com-
piled in historic times is not impaired by

- the rejection of the literal sense of the old

genealogies. From the reign of Oormac
Mac Art, or Eoehoidh Muighmedon‚ or
Niall Niagiallach, down to the' twelfth cen-

tury, Irish genealogies are aa authentiejas

though it is unanimousiy accorded to Man,
accounts disagree on the nine reglons from
which the hostages were taken 3 “ the ma-
ritime parts of Gaul and Great Britain ”-
are mentioned as being the foreign depen-
deneies (Oyyyia, p. 400), which probably
is true as far as Alba is concerned3 but in
other counnies the hoaetayes taken were all·
t’he plunder and captives that the bordes of
Niall could stow into their boats or cur-
rachs. Perhaps the' nine hostages could l
be found ‘within the coasts of Erin, which,'
