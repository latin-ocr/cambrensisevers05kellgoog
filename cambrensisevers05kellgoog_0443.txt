· the three sons of Kearmod Melbheoil [melleo ore]‚ held· the sceptre during
thirty years, not associated in the throne, but each governing in turn
as sole monarch during one year. The proper name of the first was
Eathor, his surname Mac Cuill being derived from an idol, “ Coll” (or,
son of the hazle), which he worshipped. The proper name of the second
was Teathorg he was called Mac Ceacht, from “ceacht” (the plough),
,which he worshipped as his idol. The third worshipped the sun, and
hence the name Mac Greine' (“grian ’² signifying the 'sun in Irish), sub-
stituted for his original name, Ceathor. The three fell in the battle of
Tailtin; the first was slain by Eiber, the second by Eireamon, the third

In the year of the world 3500, and 1258= years after the deluge‚ the

the chronology of the Septuagint, allowing
5199 years from the creation to the birth

her-ty, nrging him to collate the ancient
Irish authorities, and clear up, if possible,
the obscur-ities that had often perplexed
,them in Irish chronology. O’Flaherty ap-
plied himself to the task, and, in 1665,
wrote a letter to Dr. Lynch (prefixed to
the Oyyqia), in which he states that those
who adopted the period of 5199 years were
influe-ced more by extravagant natiohal
vanity than by respect for the best Irish
writers. He proves that Irish chronologists
did not differ much from Scaliger.-- 093(-
