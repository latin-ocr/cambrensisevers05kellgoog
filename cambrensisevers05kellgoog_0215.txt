From the (ext, “ Jabal was the father‘ of those that dwell in tents, and
of shepherds; Jubal was the father of those that played on the harp end
- orgen ς end Tubalcein was a hammer-er and an artificer in every work
of brass end iron,'’—-it would appear to me thet, from the creetion, the
primitive inhabitants of the earth restricted the culture of the several
arts to particular families. · acustom which, with their blood, descended

But, returning from this digression to the Irish lenguege, it is at
this day so generally diffused through Ireland‚ that it is strictly our
vernacular tongue¹²3 and, os course, when Giraldus wrote, and when
the English had but lauded, and had not made extensive settlements,
it must have fiourished in its full beauty and perfection3 so that neither
then, nor now, can the use of the English tongue in Ireland be urged
as a proof of the subj ugatio'n of the Irish'.

The adoption of the English dress supplies no better proof of the
conquest of Irelsnd by the English. It ιε only within my own days that
English dress has been commonly worn. We never were victims of such
fickleness that, like Proteus, we should be constantly changing our
dress, secording to the fleeting fashions daily imported from England.

learned from the preceding notes, and from
the report presented to the Queen in 1599,
wherein it is stated that the want of
schools “to leam younglings the English
