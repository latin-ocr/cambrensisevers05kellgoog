or sum to be levied in penalty of his death, in order that it might
be the more easily recovered, in the event of the sheriff being elain.
It was within my own days thet the territories of the O’Tooles end
O'Byrnes, lying between Dublin end Wexford‚ were formed into the
eounty called, in English, Wicklow, in Irish‚ Kilmantainu. Truly,
therefore, hes Devis declama, “ that two-thirds of Ireland were go-
verned by the ancient lawe, and hed not been reduced to shire-ground',
either in reality or name3 so that in them the lews of Englend could
not possibly be put in execution.” And with equal truth‚ he adds,
immediately after, ‘⁴ that, in Irelsnd, the King’s lews were not obeyed
within twenty miles compass. Whereupon grew thet byword used by

· the Irish, ‘ thet they dwelt bywest the lew who dwelt beyond the river

Berrow? which is within thirty miles of Dublinve’

The English, moreover, treating the native Irish not merely ss
eliens, but es enemiee‚ refused to extend to them thesbenefit of English
lawe. All the Irish indiscriminetely‚ with the exception of five fami·
lies, end a few individuale registered by name in the public reeords,
were exclude& like eliens, from the rights of English citizenship.
Davis thus gives, from the public recor-ds, the names of the five fami·
lies which had aequis-ed the rights of English lew: “ Those who ere
entitled toEnglish lew”(quoed brevia portende) “ere‚ O'Neill of Ulster,
O’Melsghlin of Meath, O’Conor of Connaught„ O’Brien of Thomond,
and Mese Murrough of Leinster¹.” This privilege, es some say, can
hardly be reconciled with the feet that, when O’Neill was about to be
married to e daughter of the Earl of Kildare in the year 1480, the
twentieth of Edwerd 1V.‚ he obtained from Parliament permission to
marry any of the English he pleased, without any mention being mede
of the former privileger. But what more convincing proof of the elien

English law so early es 1216. -Μοονε,

remonstranee, perhaps, exaggerates the un-

Irish.
