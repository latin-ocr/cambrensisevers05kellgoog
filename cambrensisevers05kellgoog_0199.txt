sistible force of the invading power, to adopt the language, dress, and
laws of their conquerors‚ Yet, when Stanihurst laid down these condi-
tions as 'essential to a real conquest, I am inclined to think he consulted
his own fancy rather than historical authorities; for it ‘i's evident that
several conquered countries never renounced their own dress, language,

or laws, for the dres3‚ language, and laws of their conquerere. An
examination of each, in detail, proves that they cannot be admitted
as undoubted tests of conquest: successful invaders have frequently
adopted the language of the conquered people. The Trojans, it is said,
conquered Italy; yet their lang-uage soon became obsolete, and the origi-
nal lang-uage of the country was the only one spoken by the victors and
the vanquished, a circumstance to which virgil alludes in the favor
granted to J uno by Jupiter, that

“ The Ausonian Iaws and language he preserved.”

The Romans zealously cultivated ¹the Greek language‚ though it was en-
tirely different from their own, and spoken by a nation which the power
of their ‘arms had reduced to complete subjection beneath the sceptre of
Rome. The N ormam, after the lapse of some time, adopted the mother
tangue of the conquered English. There is even reason to believe that
self-interest, rather than any express law on the matter, has been the
motive that led conquered nations to adopt the language of their mas-
ters. For as the fallen race must have frequently appeared before the
legal tribunals of the conquerors‚ a knowledge of the languages spoken
by the judges was indispensable for a favorable verdict. “ Thus the
Roman Praetors never used any language but their- own in the admi-
nistration of the law, and in official communicationS. N ay, so excessive
was the admiration of the Romans for their own soft and melodious
magne* that no necessity could compel them to use any other in their
intercourse, contractis, or connexions with the people.” Hence it is
easy to conceive why ‘⁴ the Brit‘ons, who had at first despised the Latin
language, grew ambitious of eloquence,” though we can infer from
