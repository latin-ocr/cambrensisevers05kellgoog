surnamed Maccon, claimed the royal power, and reigned thirty years. A· D·
While he was yet en infant 1n the palace of Olill and not able to walk, 118- 250
crept on 811· foui-s to 8 greyhound, which licked and fawned on him so
affectionately, that theneeforward Lugheidb conceived en extraordinery
attachment to the animal, and could never bear to have him from his side.
This was the origin of his minume„ Maccon, which means literally son
of the greyhounffl. Having for 8 considerable period resided 8ι Tarii,
he was at last driven to Munster by Cot-mac, son of Arthur, where he
distributed treasures of gold and silver to the learned men, and every
other order, that flocked aronnd him from 811 quat-tera. But FerguS,
son of Comen, one of the Druids‚ being hired by Cormae, who had long
sought in vein an opportunity of assassinating his rival, mming to the
plnoe,-nnd mingling with the immense crowd, watched Lughaidh, who
was leaning on his chariot, and, steeling behind him, plunged 8 spear
into hie back. Lughaidh expired on :the spotd, A. D. 225, A. M. 5424.
Fergus, King of Ulstere, sui-named Dubhdedach‚ or the black-toothed,
from the color of the two rows of his teeth, having supplanted Cormac 253
Mne Art, aseended the throne, end, adding insult to injury, ordered one
of his retinue to apply 8 torch to Cormac’s hair, after inviting him to
8 banquet‘. Gortuae, after this indignity, was banished to Connaught3
but, burning with rage sor this disgraceful treatment, he induced Tadhg,
son of Kian, and grandson of Olill Olum, Lughaidh Lagbe, son of Mogh
N uadhat, thirty kings and fifty chiliarchs‚ to march with an immense army,
against the UltoninnS, whom they encountered at Crinnabreagh. In the
battle, Lughaidh eut off the heeds of the three brotherS, Fergus Foltlea-
bhoir, of the long tresse83 Pergus Casfiachlach, of the crooked teeth3 and
Fergus of the black teeth3 and presented them to King Cormac as an
'atonement for the injury and digrace which they had inflicted on him.
By this achievement he sought to expiate, in some way, the death of
Arthur, father to Coi-mac, in the battle of Magh·Mucruimhe. Teige, son
of Kian, also charged seven times in the battle, end made terr⁸1ble havoc⁸‚
