quire a knowledge of it¹; though, within my own memory, Sir Matthew
de Rienzfl, a native of Oologne, was so profoundly versed in it, that he
compiled an Irish Grammar. He then tells a story of a certain person
in Rome, who was possessed by the devil, and wh0, although she could
speak all other languages, either could not or would not speak Irish3
because, as Stanihurst jocularly observes, a language so sacred should
not be profaned by so unhallowed lips3 or rather, as he insinuates‚
because it was so uncouth and barbarous, that the devil himself could
not master itk. This unfavorable judgment on⁰the Irish must be at-
tributed to Stanihurst’s ignorance: like the Spaniard‚ who thought the
German was so rough and harsh, that it must have been the language

’ spoken by flod, when he wished to reprove and strike greater terror

into Adam. But a German retortetL by declaring his belief that the

Spanish language was so insinuating and pompous, that it must have
’ been the one spoken by the serpent, when he lured Eve to her min,
by the captious suares of fraud and crafty suggestions.

A proof of the sweetnesa rather than of the harshness of the Irish --
language, may be deduced from Stanihurst’s complaint‚ that the Irish
was a greater favor-ite with the colonists of the English Pale, than the
English ever was with the Irish¹. For while he admits that the Irish
disdained to strain their jaws by speaking English, he complains bit-
terly that his own countrymen were not so averse to the Irish2 and

in doubt whether the Apostles, in their eo-
pious mart of languages, could have spoken
Irish if they were opposed: whereat the
company heartily laughed.’'— The Decet-ip.
of Iieland, p. 7. The belief that the devil
could not speak Irish was popular, it ap-
pears, in the seventeenth century (Mason’e
Bedell, p. 265); but how it orig-insted the
‘Editor knows not, it· it were not a sai-casm
levelled against the English officials, who,
it may be supposed, were generally ignorant
of the Irish language.
