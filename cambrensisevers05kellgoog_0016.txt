by Francis Kirwan‚.Bishop of Killala‚ and, uncle of Dr. Lynch.
Some of these clerical exiles were engaged in professional dutieS‚
but our author’s time must have been devoted to his books.

His translation of Keating into elegant Latin, Ι think, was
his first productiori, and composed in Irelau‘d. The preface gives
a just estimate of Keating’s work for industry and honesty‚ re-
futes the objections urge‘d against its publication, and demands
for its manifest deficiencies that indulgence from Irishmen, which
all nations have extended to those who had first endeavoured to
compile a national history. The style of Dr. Lynch's preface,
though fair, is deficient in that ease which characterizes a large
portion of his Subsequent ·writingS. The translation is free, some-
times paraphrastic, but always faithful.

In 1662, his great work, “ Cambrensis Eve1·sus,'' was publishod

¹under the name of “Gratianus LuciuS.” His motives in compo-sing

it may be learned from the first chapter. T hough they may appear
now not to differ from those which suggest an ordinary literary pro*
ject‚ it is certain that the want of some work of the kind had long ‘
been felt as a national calamity. From the commencement of the
1·eign··'of Elizabeth, the national antipathy ofEn'gland to every-
thing Irish was roused into aggressive acerbity, and soon found
an exponent in the literature of the day. The publication of
Giraldus Cambrensis imparted fresh vigor to this spirit, for, what-
ever Camden or Ussher might prove to the contrary, he was the

² popular oracle, especially with the small minority of new settlers

in Ireland who profited by slander. To meet that fell temper
which at last demanded, by the potent voice of Milton, nothing
less than the =extirpation of the Irish, the Catholic prelates⁰‚ in their
first breathing moment, resolved to publish‚ at the public ex-
pense, a defence of the history of Ireiand. The resolution was not

1 carried into effect, and it devolved on our author, alone and in -

exile, to execute the task. How he has acquitted himself the
reader may judge from the present volume, though it- is far less
