were, in all snooeeding ages, down to our own time, familiar dogmas of
the Christian world.

In ancient times, paganism itself was permitted, and entailed no
legal penalty. The first Christian Emperors, who laboured strenously
for the propagation of the saith of Christ, pure and undeflled, allowed
the heathens to wallow in their old superstitious, because the public
profession of paganism had priority‚ in point of time, of the general
reception of our saith. Constantine the Great, though a religious
Prince, issued an edict, securing for all his subjecte full liberty and im·
punity in the public profession of paganism. Valentinian, als0, who
had been ignominiously expelled from the army, and afterwards, when a
private man, banished for the Catholic faith, issued after his elevation an
imperial edict, which gave full liberty of religion; and he is extolled by
Amianus for never having persecuted any persons on account of their
religion. Gratian, too, passed a law securing universal toleration. The
Emperor Anastasius gave permission to every person to profess what
religion he pleased. Justinian also enacted a law to the following effect:
‘⁴ Be it enacted that every person may follow the creed of his country.”

paganism with impunity, but even the Roman Senate itself, without any
penalty or loss of its privileges, or prohibition of the Christian Emperor,
long continued to profess it. · Pagans were even raised to the highest
posts in peace and war. Thus Simmachus, while yet a slave to heathen-
ism, rose to the consulship. Gildo was appointed count of Africa by the
Emperor Theodosius ς Saul and one Cyrus were made generals os the
army, the former by stilico, the latter by the Emperor, though, at the
time of their promotion‚ both were immersed in the errors of paganism.

If pagans were neither prohibited to profess the worship of their
false gods, nor excluded from the highest civil and military offices by
the Christian Emperors, shall'not the Catholic religion, so venerable by
its antiquity‚ so wonderful in its permanence, so majestic by its univer-
sality, obtain from your Majesty even the poor favour, that its proses-
sion shall not be a crimeh? Some persons erroneously believe that it
