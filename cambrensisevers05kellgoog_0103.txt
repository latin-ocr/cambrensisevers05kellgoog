“ In that year the la‘st Superior ofour society in Ireland, who wne then lying in fover
ἰιι the house ora certain catholic citimi, was reduced so much that he could neither move
nor ride on bornebeck, nor by any other conveyanoe. An humble petition was presented
to the governor of the place, begging him to connive for a time until the sick 1111111 had,
in some degree, recovered his strength3 but the Govemormwered, “tint if one finger
oft Jesuit remained alive, though the restof the bodywere dead, both should be cnut out
of the kingdom? In the depth of a very severe winter, amid storms of wind and snow,
the siok manwas carried forty leagnes to a seaport„ where he met ten others of the society
and ior-ty seeum priests3 he embraced his fellow prisonem, with whom he was tbrown
intotheships, nndsmt offtospain. But, wonderful is themercy of God‚in the hour of
distrus, ⁴ His yoke is meet, and his burthen is light,' ‘ He permitteth none to be tempted
beyond whet they are able, '—such is his providence over our countrymen¹ that no sooner
are some priests banished than their plaoes are immediately, and contrary to all expecta-
tion, supplied by others.

“The clergy suffered many end grievous persecutione under former English Gover-
nors3 bnt, before this present time, they were never reduced to the lowest extreme of
miser-y. How severe soever the persecution rnight be in former times, the nobles and
other Gaffiolies (who formed the great majority of the nation) were allowed thetain pos-
session of their luds end housee, which offered a secure and easy retreat for the clergy;
but now the whole tace of things is changed, since the nobles and almost ell the Catholios
are ejected stom their proper-ties. What one soldier speres to-day‚ is devonred by another
soldier to-morrowss ..... So thickly do'miseries crowd around us every day, that there
remains for ns now no human resource—nothing but our confidence in the Providence of
God alone.

‘⁸ Alter the general banishment of the Cethohcs, another edict was issued‚ command-
ing alinum, of whetsoever rank or condition, to marry or quit the kingdom: there was
no resource against this edict: some were mind, others imprisoned and all reduced to the
greatest misery3 until at last, by the vigilance of their friends nnd superiora, they were
gradually drafled away in compameq and shipped‚ under the guidnnce of Providence, for
the catholic kingdoms of Spain, France, or Belgium. Το this day a few romain amongst
na, who were detained by their infirmity3 but their life is, indeed, a martyrdom.

“In this abandoned state of our country, deser-ted by her sons, all the cities and towns
are in the hands of the Cromweliiaps: every oastle and house has been changed by them
into a military post: nll public places are exposed to their excursions: no person can
pass any of the public roeds without being searched and examined et every milestone.
All niust be provided with letters or patente of the Governors, through whose districts
they travel ι the letter contains not only the name of the traveller‚ but an accurate
description of his age, stature, person, heard, and hair; and if the slightest error be
deteoted in any of these points, the bemr may be thrown* into prison asie spy or plicet,
or even hanged on the spot, acconiing to the caprice of his captor. English martial law
empowers every common soldier to pnpish all suspected persons, if they cannot produce
their licenses: at any honr of day or night the soldier may visit the houses of all the
Catholics, and search every hole or corner under pretext of hunting for priests. .....
