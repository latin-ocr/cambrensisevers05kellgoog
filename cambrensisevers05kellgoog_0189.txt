conquered by the Irishbe’ That event occurred in the reign of Char-
lemagne, and is thus recorded by Aymo: “A fleet of N orthmen having
invaded Ireland‚ the island of the Scot8‚ a battle was fought, in which
an innumerable multitude of the N orthmen were elain, and the rem·
nant fied home in disgrace.” cambrensis states that the Danes first ’
lauded in Ireland, and gained victories, and formed settlements in the
year 838⁰. It must have been, therefore, Anglee or Saxone whom
Buadan expelled. During several centuries their pirate flag had swept
the British seas. They were expert matinen, familiar wit-h the dangers
“ os the deep, and unwilling to encounter an enemy- except on their naa
tive clement. Ammianus recorda their frequent ravagee on the British
sene, and Claudian thus presente to Stilicho the gratitude of Britain:

“ Beneath his aheltering arm I fear no more
Nor Sem, nor savage Pictz along my-shore
Heedless the fickle winde may blow—no Saxon comes !”·
And again:
‘⁸ The Orkneys reek with routed Saxons’ blood3
The bleeding Picts discolor Iceland's flood;
And frozen Erin mom-ns her pilea of dead.”

· The Saxone, 1 have no doubt, descended in course of time on the
OrkneyS, and other islanda in the British seas,·whence they sent out
their armamenta against Britaind. They appear to have been leagued

dnirtheachs and stone chnrches. The date
838, in Camden's edition ὁὶ (Ξίηἱᾱιιε, does
not appear in the manuscript copy cited by

mahen-Pria, p. 860. It is manifestly “
incorrect- Giraldus states that in that,

year Tuugesius invaded Ireland‚ destroyed
chnmhes and monasteries, castellated the
whole island with raths (fossata), sur-
ronnded with deep and generally triple

tossen, and also with stone fortifications, .

of · which the ruins still remained in the
twelfth century. Τὴε tyram, according
to Giraldus, oppressed Ireland during about
thirty years, which would bring us to the
year 868, a date not supported by any Irish
authority3 Ware, O’Flaherty, the Ulster

Annals, Four Masters, and Dr. O'Oouor,

assigning the death of Tui-genius to 844-53

Ussher and Dr. Lanigan to 848 3 at which*
yearthe Ulster Annals record several bloody

defeats of the Northmen. A foreign anna-

list also, published by Du chesne (tom. ii.

p. 525), congratulata the Soots on having,

in 848, by the grace of God‚ shaken off
the yoke of the Northmen‚ and on forming
a treaty of peace and friendship with the

King of Franoe, from whom the Irish

king solicited a safe conduct to Rome. --
