bequeathed to us a critical dissection of that epistle, which Manes enti·-
tled “ the Foundation? St. Cyril of Alexandria, raised to the episeopacy
in the year of our Lord 413, wrote against Julian the Apostate‚ who
was slain in the year of our Lord 363. Eulogius, one of the successore
of cyril, exposed the falsehoods in the histories of the Nestorians 300
years after the grave had closed over Nestorius himself. But why
more? The unanImous consent os all ages has acknowledged and ap·
proved the right of every man to descend into the arena of discussion .
against anyswriter, living or dead, and to overthrow errors, however old.
or generally received. For it is' not arrogance, says St. Augustino,
to seek or defend the truth. Authority and reason, therefore, justify
us in detecting and eradicating from the minds of men the errors which
we find in the writings of authors who died several centuries before us.

I know that the wild dreams of Giraldus have been taken up
by· a herd of scribblers, and embellished by the accession of many
storias of similar stamp. It may, therefore, appear imprudent for me ⁹
to enter the Este, alone, against so many3 alone to contend against
a torrent of writers, against wind and tide, and without a fai'r omen of
success. But these writers are like a troop which blindly obeys the
general, without questioning his authority3 they follow him, either
because they have no doubt of his integrity, or because they are ani-
mated by the same fell spirit oi· calumniating the Irish, and, like asps
(as the proverb goes), imbibe poison from the viper. Not one of *the
English *mitens—those, Ι mean, who reject the catholic faith‚-—not one
of those who have written on Irish affairs can be taken as a faithful .
guide on Irish histor-5¹¹. I have read many, Ι may say all of them, and
