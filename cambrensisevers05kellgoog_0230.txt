· different from that of the other Ulster coun-

ties. De Courcy, at the eost of s'ome bloody
defeats, plaudet-ed all; he castellated and
colonized the greater part of Antrim and
Down only. With the exception of an oc-
casional invasion of an Q’Neill or an Q'Don-
nell, the latter counties lived under Eng-

lish law until the Clan Hugh-Boy O’Neill ·

established themselves firmly east of Lough
Neagh an'd the Bann, and hemmed in the
English in the Asds, where they lived under
tribute or black mail. As to the other coun-
ties, there is no proof that the English made
any permanent settlement in them previous
to the year 1600, with the exception perhaps
of the borders osCavan, and Monaghan, and
part of Armagh, and the banks of the Banu.
In Monaghan, Davis found only four names
(Mac Mahon, O’Oonnelly, M‘Kena‚ and
MacCabe) so late as 1607 (Hice. Tracts,
p. 249), “and of those the Mac Mahons were
the proudest sept among the Irish‚ and do
ever soonest repine, and kick, and spum at
English government.”-Ibid., p. 241. This
county was confiscated by the attainder of
Shane O'NeilL—p. 242. The Four Masters
do not record the erectiori of any English

castle in it for centuries after the invasion, .

except one at Clones in 1212, which was
thrown down in 1213 by Hugh O’Neill.
Fermanagh was never reduced to the Crown
by “ attainder, surrender, or other resump-
tion whatever,” before the administration of
Sir J. Perrott—Ibid„ p. 233. Cavan was
the land of the O’Reillys3 and “its pos-

sessione were never well distinguished and
established ” before the reign of Elisabeth
(Ibid.‚ p. 235), that is, we may say, it
had been in the hands of the Irish almost
exclusively. Its chieftains appear several
times giving hostages to O'Neill or O’Don-
nell during the thirteenth century. Cathal
O’Reiuy destroyed the castle of Kilmore in

1226, and in 1233 defeated the invaders, .

and gave them “neither pledge nor hos-
tage.”—Four Masters, vol. i. p. 269. One
thing appears certain, that the English ex-
peditione against 'Pyrene and Tyrconnell
were generally made, not through Cavan,
Armagh, οι· Monaghan, but fro'm Coleraine,
Cael-uisga and the castle of Sligo.

With regard to Tyr-one and Tyr-conuell,
Baton Finglas states‘that both were lest
under tribute, but does not say when or
how long—Hamis, Hib„ p. 83. O‘Mul-
don-y, lord of Tyrone and Tyrconnell, died
in the thirtieth year of his reign, 1197. He
fought to the death against De Com-cy. In
1 199 the English penetrated as sar as Dun-
gannon, but suffered a bloody defeat from

Hugh O'Neill. De Lacy was also repelled
in 1206, without hostage or submission.
Hugh O'Neill visits King John at Can-iek-
fergus in 1210, but ‚makes no submission
(Lib. Mannum, vol. i. c. iv. p. 14); burna
Carlingford 12143 gets his own demands
